,0,2026-03-01,BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL,"Respiration is crucial for identifying and diagnosing cardiovascular conditions such as sleep apnea, and other cardiovascular and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Despite the growing interest in deep learning models for comfortable respiration recognition during daily activities, current algorithms often prove complex and inefficient. Hence, there is a need for alternate, more sophisticated, and effective techniques. In this paper, a novel deep neural network (RespECG-Net) model is proposed to estimate respiration parameters using single-lead ECG signals. The experiment involved ten healthy subjects with no reported neurological and respiration disorders. Additionally, the proposed model was tested during three distinct self-paced breathing conditions (normal, fast, and slow) to evaluate its reliability and robustness. The obtained results were compared to the respiration rate (RR) measured using the gold standard commercially available sensor belt (SB). The average mean absolute error (MAE) of respiration rate using SB and RespECG-Net obtained across subjects are 1.44 +/- 1.59, 3.11 +/- 5.65, and 1.80 +/- 2.53 for normal, fast, and slow breathing conditions, respectively. The root mean square error (RMSE) between the RespECG-Net and SB across subjects in normal breathing was 2.21 +/- 1.26 bpm. Moreover, the proposed research also estimates the various temporal features associated with the respiration signal, which can aid in the diagnosis, treatment, and early prediction of cardiovascular and COPD diseases.","Engineering, Biomedical",Respiration prediction using single channel electrocardiogram signals and neural networks for healthcare applications,,[]

PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder worldwide, whose prevalence is increasing annually. Early detection is important for further intervention; however, non-specialists commonly fail to distinguish between aging motor dysfunction, or a very early motor symptom of PD. Objectives: To develop a facial-based artificial intelligence model to assess the facial features of patients with PD and investigate how artificial intelligence (AI) could help neurologists improve the performance of early PD diagnosis. Methods: We collected 70 videos of facial expressions from ""on"" stage PD patients with continuing antiparkinsonian drugs and matched controls from the Show Chwan Memorial Hospital. An AI model was developed to perform masked face recognition, based on the acquisition and evaluation in the sizes and muscle movement between facial landmarks. Results: Our AI models achieved feasible and effective facial feature recognition sufficient to assist in on-stage PD diagnosis. The accuracy of PD diagnosis using all features reached 76.5%. The random forest model with costeffective features achieved an accuracy and sensitivity of 82.4% and 83.3%, respectively. Furthermore, the accuracy and sensitivity reached 94.1% and 99.9% for typical PD patients, respectively. Conclusions: Patients with PD commonly exhibit masked facial features. Videos of a facial feature recognition-based AI model can assist with PD diagnosis and has the potential to realize remote monitoring of a patient's condition, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Engineering, Biomedical",A facial expression-based artificial intelligence model to aid in screening for Parkinson's disease: Development and validation in a cohort study,,[]
,0,2026-03-01,BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a life-threatening emergency, and early accurate diagnosis can reduce mortality. Although computed tomography angiography (CTA) is the gold standard for diagnosis, it faces challenges including risks of contrast agent allergy, contrast-induced nephropathy complications, and high healthcare resource costs. Radiologists' slice-by-slice analysis of vascular morphology using CTA relies heavily on clinical experience. and prolonged image interpretation is prone to result in missed diagnoses or misdiagnoses of microthrombi due to visual fatigue, which more easily exacerbates diagnostic delays in resource-constrained areas. This study develops PulmoNet, a framework that enables transmodal transformation from non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) to CTA-like images using a bidirectional generative network incorporating Transformer attention mechanisms, and integrates a multi-scale object detection module optimized by dynamic EMA attention and MPDIoU loss thereby forming an end-to-end automated diagnostic workflow encompassing ""image transformation and lesion localization"". Based on a dataset of 773 cases from four hospitals, the framework demonstrates effectiveness: the transmodal transformation achieves a structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.906 f 0.015 in the internal test set and 0.892 f 0.018 in the external test set; the mean average precision (mAP50) of the detection module is 0.875 f 0.018 (internal) and 0.857 f 0.020 (external), with diagnostic accuracy exceeding 93.9 % for all PE subtypes, results consistent with radiologists' diagnoses based on CTA. The study shows that this framework provides a safe alternative diagnostic solution for patients with contrast contraindications and provides specific practical references for the implementation of AI technology in emergency imaging-assisted diagnosis.","Engineering, Biomedical",PulmoNet: a transmodal deep learning framework for automated pulmonary embolism diagnosis on non-contrast CT,,[]
,0,2026-03-01,BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL,"Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis plays a critical role in cardiovascular disease diagnosis. However, traditional approaches to ECG classification and generation often rely on existent information, neglecting the integration of domain-specific knowledge. To address this limitation, we propose a novel multi-task learning architecture, MMS-Net, which simultaneously performs ECG generation and classification. The network predicts the complete lead signal from a sparse set of ECG leads and utilizes the generated signal to extract relevant features for classification. To improve disease pattern recognition, we propose an attention mechanism that highlights key leads and waveforms, focusing on the most informative ECG features. Additionally, we incorporate a multi-level feature extraction structure, capturing semantic information across multiple scales to improve the robustness and accuracy of classification. Experimental results show that MMS-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both ECG generate and classification tasks. Moreover, the integration of generation and classification tasks leads to mutual performance enhancement, demonstrating the efficacy of the multitask framework in capturing more relevant information for both tasks.

Due to extreme class imbalance of nuclei types, intra-class heterogeneity, and inter-class similarity in breast pathology images, these data challenges hinder mitosis detection, with inadequate handling of sample noise and hard samples further reducing robustness. In this paper, we propose a Difficulty-Aware Learning Paradigm (DALP) framework based on the nuclei patch level. First, the difficulty and quantity of data are balanced by the Negative Sample Search (NS). Then, Dynamic Memory Units (DMU) and Difficulty Level Evaluation (DLE) are used to select simple samples, eliminate noisy samples, and subdivide and validate the difficulty levels of hard samples to obtain a clean and refined dataset. Finally, Class-Stratified Difficulty-Guided Learning (CSDGL) aims to address the issues of intra-class heterogeneity and inter-class similarity and optimize the learning of hard samples. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ICPR2014, TUPAC2016, and MIDOG2021 datasets. Furthermore, it consistently outperforms a broad range of well-established detection algorithms on GZMH-V2, a newly released clinical dataset curated by our team. The proposed method in this paper is a plug-and-play framework that relies solely on point annotations with minimal labeling effort, highlighting its potential application for breast cancer mitosis detection.

,0,2026-03-01,BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL,"Leukemia, a fatal hematological disease caused by the abnormal proliferation of malignant white blood cells, relies heavily on microscopic image analysis of pathological samples for clinical diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Although deep learning-based computer-aided diagnostic technologies have achieved significant progress, existing approaches still face technical limitations such as low detection efficiency, high miss rates, and high false detection rates when dealing with complex microscopic imaging scenarios involving high-density distribution and complex morphological features of white blood cells. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient diagnostic framework, the FCE-YOLO model. Built upon the YOLOv8 architecture, the model integrates two novel modules, C2f_Faster and CSP_PTB, which significantly enhance global feature extraction, nonlinear representation capacity and inference speed. Furthermore, by incorporating the EMASlideLoss loss function, the model leverages historical state information during training and places greater emphasis on hard-to-classify and imbalanced samples, thereby improving classification accuracy. Trained on a blood cell image dataset covering four clinical stages of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Begin, Malignant Pre-B, Malignant early Pre-B, Malignant Pro-B), the model achieves an outstanding 99.3 % mAP@0.5 and 98 % detection precision, with an inference speed of only 2.1 ms. Compared with the original YOLOv8, it improves mAP@0.5 by 3.3 % and precision by 4.7 %, while reducing GFLOPs by 24 %. Validation on the BCCD dataset further demonstrates the model's strong generalization ability, outperforming YOLOv8 and other state-of-the-art detectors (e.g., YOLOv10, YOLOv11). Overall, the proposed model achieves high diagnostic accuracy while maintaining efficient inference, markedly enhancing the reliability and speed of ALL subtype detection. This advancement not only provides reliable technical support for optimizing clinical decision-making and capturing optimal treatment opportunities, but also contributes valuable insights for future research and applications in medical image analysis and computer-aided diagnosis.","Engineering, Biomedical",FCE-YOLO: A highly accurate and efficient model for acute lymphoblastic leukemia detection and classification,,[]
,0,2026-02-01,BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL,"During progression of gynaecological tumours, pelvic lymph node metastasis serves as a critical determinant of clinical staging, therapeutic decision-making, and prognosis. Its presence signifies disease progression to advanced stages, substantially elevating therapeutic complexity and mortality risks. However, due to the small size of lymph nodes and adhesion between lesions and surrounding tissues causing imaging contrast imbalance, the detection difficulty is greatly increased. Therefore, we propose a precise detection model for pelvic lymph node metastasis based on YOLO11. First, to enhance the expression of lymph node edge features, we design a Multi-scale Feature and Edge information extraction Convolution (MFEConv) module which improves backbone network feature extraction by combining multi-scale depthwise convolutions and differential convolution blocks. Secondly, the Feature Channel Selection aggregation Module (FCSM) is proposed, which uses the adaptive channel weight control mechanism to automatically select key information, so as to retain important discriminant features more accurately when fusing multi-scale features. Finally, to enhance the localization precision of lymph node detection, we construct the NWD-CIoU composite loss function. This function compensates for the positional sensitivity limitations of traditional IoU in small targets by incorporating the Normalized Gaussian Wasserstein Distance (NWD). Experiments on a dataset of 1,258 pelvic enhanced CT scans demonstrate that our improved model outperforms the baseline YOLO11, achieving a 6.6% increase in mAP@50, 8.5% higher precision, 1.3% improved recall, and 4.4% higher F1-score.

,0,2026-02-01,BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL,"Although deep learning (DL) methods have shown tremendous potential in many medical image analysis tasks, their practical applications are limited due to the lack of sufficient annotated data samples. By noting that the clinical radiology examinations are associated with radiology reports that describe the images, we propose to develop a foundation model for multi-model head MRI by using contrastive learning on the images and the corresponding radiology findings. In particular, a contrastive learning framework is proposed, where a mixed syntax and semantic similarity matching metric is integrated to reduce the thirst of extreme large dataset in conventional contrastive learning framework. Our proposed similarity enhanced contrastive language image pretraining (SeLIP) is able to effectively extract more useful features.

Rapid and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment. Cough analysis offers a simple, low-cost, and accessible solution for detecting respiratory diseases anytime, anywhere, with significant public health implications for early intervention. However, existing cough datasets for respiratory diseases are limited. Most studies focus on binary detection of specific diseases, with fewer exploring multi-disease detection. Additionally, single-feature input models have limited performance. To address these challenges, this paper constructs a respiratory disease cough dataset and proposes DiemaNet, a deep learning method combining temporal dimensionality reduction and attention mechanisms for automatic cough-based detection. The temporal dimension reduction module (DiffRes) enhances detailed information extraction with lower computational cost and improves attention to critical temporal frames. Efficient Multi-Scale Attention (EMA) further boosts performance by highlighting important channel and spatial information. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we constructed a cough dataset named Cough-Exp, which includes four types of cough data: Health, COVID-19, Asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Experiments show DiemaNet achieves the best performance on the dataset, with precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy of 86.2%, 85.6%, 85.9%, and 84.7%, respectively.","Engineering, Biomedical",DiemaNet: An automated detection model for three typical respiratory diseases,,[]

This study presents a Knowledge-Driven Evidence Fusion Segmentation Network (KEFS-Net), a framework that systematically integrates radiological and anatomical knowledge from medical reports with imaging features to enhance segmentation accuracy. KEFS-Net consists of three key components: (1) a knowledge-driven attention network that leverages large language models, discrete information bottleneck, and cross-attention to enhance CT image segmentation performance by capturing informative features from medical reports, (2) an evidence fusion strategy based on Dempster-Shafer theory that optimizes segmentation results by evaluating the consistency between textual knowledge and image predictions, and (3) a masked learning approach that ensures robust performance in clinical scenarios with incomplete tumor descriptions. The framework was evaluated on both the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) dataset and an external clinical dataset from the First Affiliated Hospital (FAH) of Zhejiang University School of Medicine. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving Dice of 59.10% and 59.42% respectively for tumor segmentation on the MSD and external dataset.

We develop a prediction of the functional autonomic age (FAA) from infancy to adolescence based on the ECG-derived tachogram recorded at the onset of N2 sleep. Methods: A cohort of ECG recordings from 1004 typically developing infants, children and adolescents (age range: 1 month to 17 years) was used to train feature-based and deep neural network-based regression models for the prediction of FAA. Weighted mean absolute error (wMAE) was used to define accuracy and evaluated with 10-fold cross-validation. Effect size was used to compare model accuracies and linear regression was used to evaluate confounds. The combination of FAA with an EEG-based estimate of functional brain age (FBA) was also tested. Results: A feature-based FAA had a wMAE of 1.78 years (95 %CI: 1.62-1.93, n = 1004) and was comparable to deep neural network regression (wMAE = 1.85 years, 95 %CI: 1.66-1.98). Accuracy was affected by age and age2 (t = -4.97, p < 0.001 and t = 9.66, p < 0.001, respectively) with smaller errors at younger ages, but not biological sex (t = -0.660, p = 0.510). Combining the FAA with a functional brain age derived from the EEG resulted improved accuracy, with neural networks-based methods superior (wMAE of 0.81 years, 95 %CI: 0.73-0.88, effect size D = 0.77, 95 %CI: 0.70-0.84, n = 1004).

CNNs, however, are constrained by limited receptive fields, while Transformers face scalability challenges due to quadratic computational complexity. To overcome these issues, recent studies have explored alternative architectures. The Mamba model, a selective state-space design, achieves near-linear complexity and effectively captures long-range dependencies. Its vision-oriented variant, the Visual State Space (VSS) model, extends these strengths to image feature learning.

Most segmentation methods are based on U-shaped convolutional neural networks (U-Net). Although U-Net performs well in medical image segmentation, as a method based on CNN, its main drawback lies in the difficulty of establishing long-range pixels dependencies and has a constrained receptive field, which restricts segmentation accuracy. Many models address this issue by incorporating Transformer models into U-Net architectures to better capture long-range dependencies. However, these methods often suffer from simple feature fusion techniques and limited receptive fields for local features.

Effectively distinguishing between active and inactive TB is crucial for disease treatment and transmission control. While deep learning models show potential, significant limitations persist in multi-center data scenarios. These limitations stem from intra-domain feature differences (such as individual patient variations and imaging processing changes) and inter-domain feature differences (such as variations in equipment and data distribution across medical centers). Current research has not fully addressed these challenges. To overcome this, we propose a novel model, DMTB-Net (a multi-scale convolutional network with domain generalization capability for tuberculosis diagnosis). DMTB-Net integrates a Multi-Scale Convolutional Fusion Block (MSCB) and a Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL). The MSCB module extracts features from different receptive field scales through parallel multi-scale convolutions, using feature fusion and reconstruction mechanisms to emphasize critical information and reduce redundancy. This enhances the model's ability to capture complex lesion morphologies and reduce the impact of intra-domain feature differences.

However, the accuracy of registration is frequently constrained by the ability to analyze complex textural features, which impedes the capture of finegrained deformations and elevates surgical risks. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Multi-Scale Lipschitz Neural Fields Incorporating Frequency Decoupling (MLNFFD) framework, which reformulates the registration task as the correction of high-frequency residuals based on a low-frequency coarse registration foundation. Specifically, we employ a dual-branch architecture, comprising a band-limited U-Net low-frequency branch for coarse deformation estimation, and a Multi-Scale Lipschitz Neural Fields (MLNF) high-frequency branch dedicated to refining fine-grained deformation residuals. Through a complementary joint optimization strategy, the low-frequency branch provides an initial estimation that accelerates the optimization of the high-frequency branch, while the high-frequency branch refines the deformation field and enhances local details, fostering mutual reinforcement and improving registration accuracy.

Material and methods : For this study, it was of interest to investigate the structures of electrodes by utilizing regular star polygons, fractal structures and, last but not least, the extended fractal using the Van-Koch curve. We therefore analyzed the stroke patients and improved the focality and the electric field strength of the conventional tDCS. Following segmenting the collected Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data from an ischemic stroke patient, we separated the five vital head layers. Once the electrodes were placed on the head, Finite Element Method (FEM) was used in order to simulate the electric field distribution of each segmented layer. Results: This allowed the conclusion that the fractal structures and star polygons can increase not only the norm of the average and maximum electric field distribution in different layers of the head but also the current density. Likewise, the same escalation can be expected in the average and maximum electric field of standard tDCS. Significantly superior results were achieved with our proposed model; for instance, the improvement index of the tDCS in all layers was virtually twice as high as the ordinarily used structures (rectangular and circular models). Conclusions: The proposed model has also substantial benefits in terms of enhancing the electric field in the target region regardless needing the electric-current augmentation.","Engineering, Biomedical",Effective shapes of tDCS electrodes in stroke patients: A modeling study,,[]

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of PS on the autocorrelation feature of gait. The information obtained will contribute to the methods of analysis and intervention in the rehabilitation. Methods: Unilateral traumatic trans-tibial amputees with phantom sensation (PG) (n = 10) and with no phantom sensation (N-PG) (n = 11), and healthy controls (HC) (n = 11) were recruited. Individuals walked on the treadmill at their preferred speed while inertial motion units recorded 512 consecutive steps. Gait analysis was repeated with a 5 % perturbation on the treadmill. The following signal processing methods were utilized to investigate autocorrelation function of gait: multiscale entropy (MSE), detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), rescaled range analysis (RRA), autocorrelation function (ACF), power spectral density (PSD), Lempel Ziv complexity (LZC), Higuchi fractal dimension (HFD), Katz fractal dimension (KFD), Renyi entropy (RE), and Tsallis entropy (TE). Results: PG (p = 0.049; d = 0.905) had better gait autocorrelation results than N-PG (p = 0.005; d = 1.234) on both regular and perturbed ground compared to the HC. PG showed more similar gait adaptations to healthy individuals. The LZC criterion and HFD yielded more significant results in differentiating between the groups in both ground changes and existing ground conditions (p = 0.05).

In advanced stages, surgical intervention through total knee replacement is frequently performed; however, only about two-thirds of individuals report that their knee feels ""normal"" after the procedure. Postoperative complications can also lead to additional corrective surgery. Although early stage management through physical activity and weight reduction can slow disease progression, surgical replacement remains the standard treatment for severe cases. Accurate assessment of muscle volume plays an essential role not only in the management of osteoarthritis but also in the diagnosis and treatment of conditions such as muscular dystrophy, peripheral arterial disease, neurological disorders, sports-related injuries, and age-associated muscle degeneration. Despite this, clinical practice lacks standardized and repeatable methods for muscle volume quantification, which poses a challenge for accurate diagnosis and effective intervention.

Typically, directly measured sEMG signals are prone to various noise interferences that severely affect the recognition performance, whereas existing methods are insufficient to effectively handle noise within the spectrum. Additionally, current studies pay insufficient attention to the recognition performance of models in inter-subject scenarios. Therefore, this study proposes a novel LMR method. Specifically, a sEMG denoising framework based on mode decomposition and signal reconstruction is designed to adaptively identify and eliminate noise hidden within its spectrum. Several generic deep learning models are constructed to achieve endto-end LMR using denoised signals, including typical CNN, serial CNN-RNNs, and parallel CNN-Transformer. On this basis, a transfer learning technique called weight-decomposed low-rank adaptation is integrated to maximize the applicability of the model in inter-subject scenarios with minimal increase in inference cost. A multi-metric evaluation framework is established to systematically analyze the proposed method from various aspects such as denoising effect, model performance, and time cost. Effectiveness is verified using a benchmark dataset of lower limb motions with ten healthy subjects, and a custom dataset including healthy individuals and stroke patients.

Existing techniques are often hindered by a strong reliance on manual hyperparameter tuning, sensitivity to outliers, and high computational costs. In this paper, we introduce the improved Riemannian Potato Field (iRPF), a fast and fully automated method for EEG artifact rejection that addresses key limitations of current approaches. We evaluate iRPF against several state-of-the-art artifact rejection methods, using two publicly available EEG databases, labeled for various artifact types, comprising 226 EEG recordings.

However, owing to the multi-channel and high sampling rate of acquisition devices, EEG data exhibit high dimensionality and long sequences. Most existing studies focus on analyzing individual domains, such as temporal, structural, or state features, making it challenging to effectively capture and represent the correlations among these features across multiple channels while avoiding the loss of key information in long sequential data. In addition, variations in patients' conditions result in differences in detection times, further increasing the complexity of data processing. To tackle these challenges, we propose the TSS-SSM framework, which combines spatio-temporal representation learning of temporal, structural, and state correlations with selective state-space model to effectively handle the complex features of EEG signals.

Conventional approaches-such as 1 min or 2 min HR decline exponential fits-often prioritize fitting precision, yet can show substantial variability across individuals and exercise intensities, limiting their broader applicability. In this study, we examined a Decay Time Constant (Decay TC) derived from a first-order differential model applied to HR data scaled between exercise termination and 2 min post-exercise. Thirty-five healthy adults performed robot-resisted knee-up exercises at three intensities (72, 84, and 96 RPM), with HR continuously monitored via a wireless chest sensor. Normalization based on the first-order model reduced the influence of differing starting HR values and recovery slopes, enabling the Decay TC to reflect recovery characteristics that remained relatively consistent across intensities. Correlation analysis-performed overall and by sex and age group-showed that this Decay TC maintained more stable relationships with submaximal VO2max than conventional HR recovery indicators, with moderate-to-strong correlations (|R| up to 0.93). Multivariable regression confirmed it as a significant predictor, but the aim was not to maximize VO2max prediction accuracy or optimize curve-fitting, but rather to provide a simple, interpretable measure that captures an individual's consistent recovery profile as a potential physiological signature. These findings suggest that the Decay TC obtained from scaled HR data offers a practical metric for characterizing HR recovery dynamics, with potential for integration into endurance assessment protocols and wearable health monitoring systems.","Engineering, Biomedical",Consistent assessment of heart rate recovery across exercise intensities,,[]

Using StyleGAN2_ADA, we synthesize a wide range of image samples to address data imbalance, thus improving the robustness of the training process. We further merge established convolutional neural networks such as ResNet18, ResNet50, MobileNetV3, and DenseNet121 with Vision Transformers (ViT) to create a suite of hybrid architectures. These models operate within a Flower-based federated learning ecosystem, enabling large-scale collaborative training without exposing sensitive patient information. In addition, XAI methods provide actionable insights into the decision-making of each model, thereby fostering transparency and clinical trust. Empirical tests show that the hybrid DenseNet121-ViT-B32 model achieves 98.2% precision, 95.25% recall, and 96% F1 Score, thus validating the prospects of our federated, GAN-enhanced, and XAI-supported solution for precise monkeypox detection. This framework demonstrates real-world applicability by enabling secure and scalable diagnosis, with GAN-based augmentation increasing dataset size by over 700%, significantly boosting model generalization. The research underscores the need to balance privacy-centric interventions and explainable deep models in the treatment of emerging infectious diseases and the protection of global public health.","Engineering, Biomedical",PriFL-XAI: Hybrid privacy-preserving federated learning models for monkeypox detection through GAN augmentation and explainable AI,,[]

A total of 26 distinct features are extracted from both signals and systematically categorized into three groups: cardiac, respiratory, and their interaction-based metrics. The data comprise 82 heart failure patients, all of whom underwent screening prior to cardioverter defibrillator implantation, ensuring a clinically relevant population for evaluation. Despite the absence of statistically significant differences in features identified by traditional analysis, the integration of advanced ML models, specifically Random Forest (RF) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) ML algorithms, confirms a separation between patient groups. Moreover, the valuable application of Random Over-Sampling Examples (ROSE) as a data augmentation technique is successful in addressing limitations inherent in the small and imbalanced dataset. Our results suggest that the ML algorithms can detect subtle, nonlinear relationships embedded within the complex interplay of cardiac and respiratory dynamics. The best predictive outcomes are achieved through a strategic combination of pseudo-random oversampling and undersampling, as well as through application of ensemble learning algorithms. These findings underscore the promise of ML approaches-not only in improving the predictive potential of cardiorespiratory features, but also in illuminating the critical role of respiratory features and cardiorespiratory interactions in the early identification of malignant ventricular arrhythmias among heart failure patients.","Engineering, Biomedical",Malignant ventricular arrhythmias prediction based on cardiorespiratory signals analysis and machine learning approach,,[]

Traditional detection methods relying on behavioral observations or vehicle dynamics lack the precision and real-time adaptability required to identify subtle cognitive distractions. To overcome these limitations, MultiModality Physiological Signal Analysis for Driver Cognitive Distraction Detection using Spectral Domain Reconstruction Graph Neural Network (MPS-DCDD-SDRGNN) is proposed. Initially, physiological electroencephalography (EEG) signal is continuously acquired from Cognitive State Discrimination Dataset. These raw signals were first pre-processed using the Adaptive Fast Desensitized Kalman Filter (AFDKF) to remove artifacts and enhance signal quality by eliminating noise and improving clarity. The pre-processed signals were then passed through a Local Window Attention Vision Transformer (LWAViT) to extract spatial features such as Fractal dimension, approximate entropy, coherence, synchronisation, and spatial correlations that capture variations in cognitive load associated with distraction. Then the extracted features were input into a Spectral Domain Reconstruction Graph Neural Network (SDRGNN) to detect and classify different levels of driver cognitive distraction as Active, Resting, and Focused. Hence, Star fish Optimization Algorithm (SFOA) is proposed to optimize the SDRGNN, which precisely detect the Driver Cognitive Distraction. Finally, the system is evaluated using standard classification metrics to validate its effectiveness in accurately identifying distracted driving behavior. The proposed MPS-DCDD-SDRGNN method provides 23.7 %, 23.2 % and 25.5 % greater F1Score 21.7 %, 25.2 % and 25.5 % lower MSE while compared with existing methods.","Engineering, Biomedical",Multi-Modality physiological signal analysis for driver cognitive distraction detection using Spectral Domain Reconstruction Graph Neural Network,,[]

A good noise reduction algorithm should be evaluated based on comprehensive performance, including denoising effect, operation cost, and universality. In this paper, an improved ECG denoising architecture based on bidirectional long short-term memory autoencoder (BiLSTMAE) and conditional generative adversarial nets (CGAN) was proposed and the improved algorithm performance was assessed by the proposed comprehensive metrics. Since the proposed BiLSTMAE-CGAN model more efficiently extracts temporal features from noisy ECG signals compared to the convolutional autoencoder-CGAN (CAE-CGAN), it can obtain higher denoising effect with lower computational cost. On the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database, for the seven types of mixed noise cases (i.e., three single noises and four mixed noises), the structure and hyperparameters of the BiLSTMAE-CGAN, especially for the sample length, were optimized according to the proposed metrics. The results show that when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of noisy signals varies from-5 dB to 5 dB and the sample length is 2048 samples (5.69 s), the average SNR of denoised signal can be 50 dB above, and the amount of floating-point computation is much lower than that of CAE-CGAN method. Furthermore, for the new lead and the new database (CinC2017), the proposed method also works, and the related denoised ECG signal can obtain higher diagnostic accuracy of arrhythmia.

While deep-learning approaches have shown promise in iEEG classification, existing methods are constrained by single-network architectures, restricting the diversity of extracted information and failing to fully exploit complementary information from both temporal and spectral domains. To this end, we propose a dual-branch temporal-spectral fusion model (DTSF), which employs a dual-branch CNN-GRU architecture to extract temporal and spectral features within domains, and a transformer fusion module to explore the global relationships between domains. Specifically, the temporal and spectral branches extract features from the raw signal and its STFT representation, respectively, where CNN captures local patterns in the features and GRU models their long-range dependencies. Features from both branches are fused using a Transformer-based block with a self-attention mechanism, which dynamically adjusts the importance of temporal and spectral features based on their contextual relationships, capturing the global dependencies between both domains to generate a unified temporal-spectral representation for final classification.

However, mainstream methods that introduce Transformers by replacing the encoder, decoder, or the entire architecture, while enhancing global modeling capabilities, often fail to precisely segment complex pathological features. Recently, the Mamba architecture has garnered significant attention in the field of vision. By integrating structured state space models (SSMs) with gated convolutions and introducing a selective scanning mechanism, Mamba achieves a global receptive field and efficient computational performance.

,0,2026-02-01,BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL,"Objective: The purpose of reducing full connectivity correlation matrix is to preserve critical functional connections while decreasing redundancy, improving computational efficiency, and enhancing network interpretability. The simplified functional brain network maintains strong connections but removes weak ones, without capturing excitatory and inhibitory neurons average activities. In fact, weak correlations may reflect the average activities of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Approach: Based on the principle of the average activities of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, a new percolation theory-based reduction method for the full connectivity correlation matrix of functional brain network on EEG is proposed. Firstly, finding excitatory and inhibitory neurons and their average activities. Channels corresponding to the instantaneous global minimum and maximum potentials among all channels are considered as representing excitatory or inhibitory neurons, and designate these channels as percolation origins. As well as channels showing minimum variance of correlation among channels in a fixed-time-window are considered as representing their average activities of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Secondly, deriving the strongest and weakest correlations and permeating. Starting from the origin, select the strongest and weakest correlations for node-edge composite percolation until all nodes are connected. Finally, the validity of the origin selection is validated by statistical analysis on fatigue detection, emotion recognition and motor imagery datasets. Main results: The statistical results show that the correlation minimum variance distribution is brain-wide. On fatigue detection and emotion recognition, the instantaneous global minimum and maximum potentials are predominant in the prefrontal and occipital lobes of the brain, which are mainly responsible for functions such as behavioral regulation, decision-making, emotion and vision. Motor imagery is predominant in the occipital and temporal lobes of the brain, which are mainly responsible for functions such as vision, memory, and discriminating between left and right. Meanwhile, network metric and robustness comparison experiments are conducted between the proposed method and the current methods such as thresholding, CST, MST, USPT and ECO. The experimental results show that the network efficiency and robustness of the functional brain network constructed with proposed method are high. Significance: The percolation threshold retains the strong and weak correlation of the full connectivity correlation matrix. The minimum variance of the correlation among channels characterizes the average activities of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Therefore, the constructed functional brain network characterizes the brain function more completely and establishes a reliable foundation for subsequent analysis.","Engineering, Biomedical",A percolation theory-based reduction method for the full connectivity correlation matrix of functional brain network on EEG,,[]

However, its utility is often compromised by fan-shaped guidewire artifacts generated by the mechanical rotating probe, which obscure vascular structures and hinder diagnostic accuracy and quantitative analysis. Existing methods face challenges due to the complex structure of guidewire artifacts and the lack of clinically relevant paired datasets. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel framework for guidewire artifact removal. First, a linear model is used to represent guidewire artifacts, departing from the conventional additive model, by considering the imaging principles of guidewire artifacts. Second, a half-cutting strategy is proposed to create unpaired training datasets, consisting of half-images with and without guidewire artifacts, enabling effective unsupervised learning. Third, an IVUS Guidewire Artifact Removal Network (IGARN) is designed based on image-to-image translation. Extensive experiments on synthetic and clinical datasets demonstrate that IGARN outperforms some widely used unsupervised image translation methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. It effectively removes guidewire artifacts while preserving main features in artifact-free areas.

However, existing multi-modality MRI reconstruction methods face two key challenges: the insufficient integration of multi-scale features and the redundancy of frequency information. To address these issues, we propose a Mamba-driven multi-modality MRI reconstruction method, termed SFM-Net, which incorporates scale diversity fusion and frequency domain purification. Specifically, we introduce a low rank fusion Mamba (LRFM) that processes global and local features from global feature capture blocks (GFCB) and local feature capture blocks of different modalities to effectively fuse multi-scale feature. The lightweight low rank mechanism ensures effective interaction and integration of cross scale features. Additionally, to prevent feature distortion caused by the loss of frequency domain information and reconstruction artifacts resulting from redundant information during the reconstruction process, we introduce a frequency-domain decoupling Mamba (FD2M) that constructs multiple weights with diverse frequency responses. By adjusting these weights element-wise, we effectively distinguish between highly similar frequency domain information, suppressing artifacts and blurring.

However, OCT images are often degraded by speckle and detector noise, obscuring critical morphological structures and compromising image sharpness. Achieving effective noise suppression while preserving fine-grained anatomical details remains a key challenge for existing methods, especially in retaining subtle pathological features. To address this, we propose a novel Cross-Domain Knowledge Integration Framework (CDKIF) that integrates segmentation and classification networks to guide denoising optimization. Specifically, our method distills explicit boundary priors from a segmentation network and transfers this spatial awareness to the denoising network via targeted parameter sharing, significantly enhancing edge preservation. Moreover, domain-adapted perceptual loss, computed using features from a fine-tuned classification network, specifically reduces the blurring of pathological structures and fine layer details. Finally, we propose a multistage pipeline combining Cluster-Weighted Multi-scale (CWM) based spatial regularization and temporal averaging to generate high-fidelity noise-free labels, eliminating paired-data dependency and artifact risks associated with conventional averaging.

Using the elevated stiffness of cancerous tissue, quantitative micro-elastography (QME) shows promise for margin assessment by imaging microscale tissue elasticity. Clinical translation of QME can require the use as an adjunct to frozen section analysis (FSA), an intraoperative procedure involving rapid freezing of tissue. However, it remains unclear how rapid freezing affects tissue elasticity, potentially influencing QME's capability to detect cancer. This study assessed the impact of rapid freezing on microscale tissue elasticity, using a custom QME system and data processing algorithm. QME imaging was performed on 14 breast specimens from BCS and mastectomy, before and after rapid freezing and thawing. QME images indicated overall consistent tissue elasticity features between the fresh and thawed tissue. Quantitative analysis of 983 selected tissue subregions demonstrated characteristic changes: stroma (n = 319) and low-and intermediate-grade invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC, n = 359) showed a small increase of elasticity by 0.5 kPa and 2.0 kPa respectively, whilst high-grade IDC (n = 80) and ductal carcinoma in situ (n = 225) presented a moderate decrease by 5.8 kPa and 5.0 kPa, respectively. These changes did not corrupt the elasticity contrast between benign (median: 6.1 kPa) and cancerous tissue (median: 42.9 kPa), suggesting QME's feasibility for assessing breast tissue after rapid freezing and thawing.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely employed for motor imagery (MI) classification to extract these correlations and decode electroencephalography (EEG) signals. However, the inherent small perceptual field of CNNs limits their use in extracting global dependencies, leading to substantial information loss over time. Transformers can potentially mitigate this problem with their attention mechanism capable of extracting the correlation among features in the long-sequence time-series data. This study proposes a novel end-to-end framework for EEG decoding using improved feature extraction and classification methods to enhance the MI classification performance. Specifically, a parallel architecture of transformer (TF) and CNN (TF-CNN) is proposed to extract the global dependencies and local temporal features. The local temporal features from CNN and the global correlation features from the transformer are further fused together and classified using ridge regression extreme learning machine (rELM).

This study introduces a novel classification framework for detecting directional BP changes-systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP) and mean (MBP)-using continuous photoplethysmography (PPG) signals and a single initial BP calibration. Data from 1,626 patients in the Vital Signs Database (VitalDB) with synchronised PPG and BP recordings were analysed.

Given its substantial impact on social functioning, timely diagnosis and early intervention are crucial to improve the living quality of patients. Although significant progress has been made in diagnosing ASD using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) based on previous studies, most of these models focused only on the static or dynamic brain network without considering their complementary interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-attention based static-dynamic fusion network (SDF) for the identification of ASD with three sections: static branch, dynamic branch, and fusion module.

,0,2026-02-01,BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are effective at extracting local features but are limited in capturing long-term dependencies due to their fixed kernel size. In contrast, Transformers are capable of capturing longrange dependencies through the self-attention mechanism.Although there are frameworks that extract both local and global features by combining CNN with Transformer in brain-computer interface (BCI) systems, multi-view features have not been effectively explored in Electroencephalography (EEG) decoding. Moreover, the increased computational complexity introduced by the attention mechanism in Transformers poses challenges, hindering their application to EEG signals with long sequence. Therefore, a novel Convolutional Transformer-based multi-view Interaction and Fusion Network (CT-MIFNet) is proposed. Initially, the preprocessed EEG signals are passed through a spatial transformation module, which reduces dimensionality while minimizing noise. After undergoing fast fourier transform (FFT) and branching into two separate paths, the signals are input into a Patch Embedding module with multi-scale convolution mapping to extract temporal, frequency, and spatial features. Subsequently, to enhance feature representations, these local features are processed by the Transformer-based Feature Interaction and Fusion module, which leverages Cross-Covariance Attention (CCA) to reduce computational complexity while facilitating the exchange and fusion of feature tokens from various perspectives. Extensive experiments showed that CT-MIFNet demonstrated the superior performance and generalization ability on the BCI Competition IV-2a, BCI Competition IV-2b, and the EEG datasets for laser-evoked pain datasets, achieving accuracies of 81.67%, 86.75%, and 83.48%, respectively.

To address these issues, Echo State Networks (ESNs) have been introduced, leveraging non-gradient-based learning to eliminate backpropagation and pre-training. While ESNs have demonstrated effectiveness in capturing the dynamic nonlinear features of EEG signals, their integration with deep learning classifiers, the impact of reservoir size, and comprehensive comparisons with traditional machine learning methods remain underexplored. This study bridges these gaps by investigating three key aspects. First, we propose a novel ESN-TLC model that integrates ESN with Transformer blocks, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Evaluated on the DEAP dataset, ESN-TLC achieves classification accuracies of 93.9% for arousal and 94.2% for valence, demonstrating competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods. Second, we analyze the influence of reservoir size on deep learning classifiers, providing insights for optimal parameter selection. Third, we compare ESN-based feature extraction with the widely used Power Spectral Density (PSD) method, showing that ESN outperforms PSD in both accuracy and computational efficiency, even with a small reservoir. The results underscore the benefits of integrating ESN with deep learning components in the ESN-TLC model, enabling effective and computationally efficient capture of temporal dynamics and spatial features in EEG data, a critical requirement for real-world applications like personalized emotion recognition, adaptive neurofeedback, and advanced Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) control.","Engineering, Biomedical",An investigation of echo state network for EEG-based emotion recognition with deep neural networks,,[]

However, under low-photon conditions, severe image noise can lead to prominent artifacts and the loss of fine structural details. Existing self-supervised denoising methods often rely on masking or downsampling operations, which make it difficult to simultaneously suppress noise and preserve high-frequency features. To address this limitation, we propose NDR-SIM, a self-supervised denoising framework tailored for SIM images. By introducing a physically inspired strategy of noise decomposition and recorruption, NDR-SIM constructs training image pairs without requiring clean ground truth labels. The method leverages the Poisson-Gaussian noise characteristics inherent to fluorescence microscopy to generate a pair of statistically complementary noisy views from raw SIM images, and utilizes the high-fidelity reconstruction algorithm HiFi-SIM to provide effective supervisory signals. Experimental results on both synthetic and real biological datasets demonstrate that NDR-SIM achieves superior robustness and structural fidelity across various noise types and signal-to-noise ratio levels, significantly outperforming existing classical and deep learning-based denoising methods.

To overcome the limitations regarding these two issues, we propose an advanced semi-supervised chromosome segmentation method- CI3SM (Class Imbalance Skeleton Semi-Supervised Model). CI3SM enhances model consistency and accuracy on unlabeled data by leveraging cross-pseudo supervision and a dual-path skeleton data augmentation strategy. To tackle issues of low segmentation accuracy for small chromosomes and slow category training speed, CI3SM incorporates a CIMM (Class Imbalance Mitigation Module) and a CISCM (Class Intelligent Speed Control Module).

This work uses our real-time dielectric signature measurements of breast cell lines collected from the Open-Ended Coaxial Probe (OECP) to detect breast cancer effectively. The dataset comprises five breast cell lines-four cancerous and one normal-recorded with and without a culture medium. Existing approaches from the literature often struggle with manual feature extraction, poor handling of sequential data, and limited effectiveness when applied to real-time databases.

While electroencephalography (EEG) is being widely researched as a probable tool for non-invasive PD detection, its complex nature calls for advanced technology to extract and understand the features of this signal, and deep learning (DL) is suitable for this task. However, the inclusion of full-cap EEG setups (e.g., 32+ channels) increases acquisition complexity and computational cost and hinders clinical scalability. This research proposes a technique for EEG channel selection for PD detection by identifying channels that most influence the DL model's decisions. For better analysis, EEG is transformed, channel-by-channel, into time-frequency images using Stockwell-transform. These images are used to train a deep convolution neural network model and generate class saliency maps, an Explainable AI (XAI) technique, using the backpropagation of gradients. The saliency maps are processed via a novel average region intensity-EEG channel selection (ARIECS) technique to select the fewest channels that most significantly impact the PD detection process. Two publicly available datasets were used to validate the approach, achieving detection accuracy of 98% and 96% utilizing only 16 of the 32 original channels, with P4, CP2, and PZ emerging as the most impactful.

To address the issues, this study proposes a multi-domain EEG feature fusion network with supervised contrastive learning (namely MDFFNet-SCL) for epileptic seizure prediction. MDFFNet-SCL first employs five types of data transformations to generate the positive samples of anchor EEG samples.

As part of this development, we applied and compared recent deep learning image classification architectures for photothrombotic lesion and necrotic cells located region in histopathological brain images of photothrombosis-induced rabbit models. To be detailed, six deep learning image classification architectures (ResNet-18, MobileNet V2, EfficientNet B0, InternImage and DenseNet-121/169) based on convolutional neural network (CNN) were applied to detect and distinguish photothrombotic lesion and areas with necrotic neuronal cells from H&E or Cresyl Violet (Nissl) stained brain tissue images. All six deep learning architectures provided high accuracy of over 98% within 500 training epochs. Notably, InternImage, DenseNet-121/169 achieved the top performance, with an accuracy of 99.85%, F1 score of 0.9985, and the lowest loss (0.0193) on H&E-stained images. In Nissl-stained image classification, a combination of high accuracy (99.69%) and rapid inference (4.384 s) in DenseNet-121 makes it particularly suited for real-time histological analysis, where speed is important for decision-making.

Current methods for analysing the motor characteristics such as acceleration and velocity using magnetoencephalography (MEG) are able to offer satisfying performance, but are facing limitations of the redundancy of channels and limited considerations of causality, which hinder their adaptation to the limited-channel OPM-MEG systems and the methods' interpretability. Here we propose an algorithm with a causality-aware hybrid decoding network and a voting channel selection method for a 3-D finger movement prediction task. The channel selection employs correlation analysis based on the sliding window average power during the trial period, and bases its selection with reference channels heavily related to the visual and motor area of the brain. The network adopts unidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) layers which respect the signals' causality, and convolutional layers to further extract information from the signals. The strategy is able to achieve an average correlation of 0.849 +/- 0.050 for the worst axis of the trajectories in an open-source SQUID-MEG dataset with only 18 channels adopted, outperforming current methods in the correlation and channel usages. The algorithm is robust and lighter to prepare in the aspect of both placing MEG channels and data analysis, building a solid foundation for the usage in both traditional SQUID-MEG systems and agile OPM-MEG BCI systems with the potential for real time processing.","Engineering, Biomedical",Unidirectional LSTM-based 3D reaching trajectory prediction using selected magnetometer-only SQUID-MEG channels,,[]

However, most existing approaches primarily focus on in-plane degradation and reconstruction, often neglecting accurate modeling of through-plane degradation. We propose a blind isotropic SR method based on dual-input degradation modeling. Our approach employs a non-paired volumetric MR image dual-input architecture to capture the through-plane degradation process more effectively. This design addresses the limitations of conventional singleinput frameworks, which rely on in-plane directional features and therefore fail to simulate actual through-plane degradation, ultimately degrading SR reconstruction quality. To mitigate feature representation bias when processing multi-scale MR images, we incorporate a scale-aware module based on conditional convolutions within the degradation network. This module dynamically adapts to scale variations, enhancing the network's ability to model complex degradations. Extensive experiments conducted on the ITKTubeTK and BraTS2013 datasets across multiple scales demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing single-input approaches in modeling through-plane degradation and achieves superior isotropic SR reconstruction performance.","Engineering, Biomedical",BIDeM-SR: blind isotropic MRI super-resolution via dual-input degradation modeling,,[]

Recently, the introduction of vision transformers (ViTs) has significantly altered the landscape of deep segmentation models, due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies. However, we argue that the current design of the ViT-based UNet (ViT-UNet) segmentation models is limited in handling the heterogeneous appearance (e.g., varying shapes and sizes) of target objects that are commonly encountered in medical image segmentation tasks. To tackle this limitation, we present a structured approach to introduce spatially dynamic components into a ViT-UNet. This enables the model to capture features of target objects with diverse appearances effectively. This is achieved by three main components: (i) deformable patch embedding; (ii) spatially dynamic multi-head attention; (iii) multi-scale deformable positional encoding. These components are integrated into a novel architecture, termed AgileFormer, enabling more effective capture of heterogeneous objects at every stage of a ViT-UNet. Experiments in three segmentation tasks using publicly available datasets (Synapse multi-organ, ACDC cardiac, and Decathlon brain tumor datasets) demonstrated the effectiveness of AgileFormer for 2D and 3D segmentation tasks. Remarkably, our AgileFormer sets a new state-of-the-art performance with a Dice Score of 85.74% and 87.43 % for 2D and 3D multi-organ segmentation on Synapse without significant computational overhead.

The proposed SETD-Net consists of a multi-scale spatiotemporal enhancement subnet, a multi-granularity temporal difference subnet, and an adaptive fusion subnet. In the first subnet, a multi-scale enhancement structure (MES), which employs symmetric multi-scale convolution operations to perform bidirectional convolution on spatiotemporal contexts, meticulously captures fine-grained global spatiotemporal semantics of facial behaviors at different scales. In the second subnet, a multi-granularity difference mechanism (MDM), which utilizes first- and second-order temporal difference operations to encode the changing characteristics of facial movements, extracts dynamic difference semantics at different granularities. In the adaptive fusion subnet, a dual-stage attention strategy (DAS) is designed to effectively fuse the global spatiotemporal semantics and the dynamic difference semantics. Specially, to reduce computational complexity and adapt to small-sample depression datasets, a plug-and-play 3D inverted residual module (3D-IR), which leverages depthwise separable convolution to replace the full-channel convolution in the 3D-CNN, is constructed and embedded into the first two subnets.

,0,2026-02-01,BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL,"Background: Ballistocardiogram (BCG), a vibration signal generated by cardiac ejection, demonstrates promising potential for blood pressure (BP) estimation. Existing data-driven models estimate BP from BCG as black-box predictors and therefore generalize poorly across populations while offering little physiological insight. Methods: Building on recent findings that BCG is a superposition of intra-aortic blood pressure waveforms (BP waveforms), we propose a B-spline based BP waveform decomposition (BPWD) to extract BP waveform features for BP estimation. By leveraging particle swarm optimization to refine B-spline control points, BPWD generates physiologically plausible BP waveforms whose superposition (generated-BCG) aligns morphologically with measured-BCG. However, between generated-BCG and measured-BCG, there is a scaling discrepancy (Sd) that affects BPWD. In our study, two BPWDs have been proposed: BPWD_avgSd uses the average Sd value of all measurements with known BP values; BPWD_optSd optimizes Sd in terms of both the pulse pressure difference calculated using a prior formula based on BCG waveform features and height and weight, and root-mean-square error between the generated BCG (scaled by Sd) and the measured BCG. Results: Based on 69 measurements from 23 participants, linear-regression models built on BP waveform features extracted by BPWDs outperformed the model built on BCG waveform features. The mean absolute error (mmHg) for diastolic/systolic/pulse pressure were BPWD_optSd-5.9/8.9/7.4; BPWD_avgSd-6.0/9.3/7.6; and BCG waveform features-6.5/11.5/8.7, respectively. Conclusions: BPWD effectively decomposes the BCG into BP waveforms whose features better support linear-regression BP estimation than BCG waveform features. The superior performance of BPWD_OptSd over BPWD_avgSd demonstrates that optimizing Sd further enhances BPWD performance.","Engineering, Biomedical",Accurate blood pressure waveform decomposition and feature extraction using Ballistocardiogram mechanism,,[]

The paper addresses segmentation domain adaptation for enhanced white blood cell image classification. By leveraging cross-domain segmentation information, we boost the learning of intracellular representation for white blood cells without the interference of the backgrounds. The whole network training is composed of domain adaptation training and task training. While the first aims to learn segmentation information from the source datasets, the second aims to apply the segmentation domain knowledge to assist feature training for WBC classification. To fully utilize the encoder feature, we propose spatial co-occurrence feature embedding to enhance comprehensive information of the input image and boundary detection of the nucleus. To learn a better intercellular structure, a reconstruction loss is proposed to enforce the network to learn correct nucleus and cytoplasm shapes. During task training, a nuclear-cytoplasmic knowledge-aware classifier is trained based on the domain adaptation knowledge of nuclear and cytoplasmic features to mitigate background interference and achieve better WBC classification results. Our approach achieves a new state-of-the-art weighted average F1-score of 99.21% in the PBC dataset, outperforming the second best method by 1.83%.

While recent methods have achieved notable progress, they often suffer from two critical limitations: (1) inadequate frequency and spatial feature representation, as most approaches remain biased toward spatial-domain learning and, even when incorporating frequency information, tend to overlook the hierarchical variability of frequency distributions across feature levels, resulting in suboptimal utilization of frequency cues; and (2) insufficient cross-level feature integration, limiting the ability to effectively capture both global semantics and fine-grained boundary details. To address these issues, we propose PSFS-Net, a novel dynamic frequency-spatial synergistic polyp segmentation framework that jointly leverages spatial and frequency domain information for hierarchical context refinement and cross-level fusion, which mainly includes Frequency-aware Cross-scale Fusion Module (FACFM), Dual-stream Global-Local Interaction Module (DGIM), and Dual Attention Cross-modulation Module (DCM).

TCM medical records are detailed accounts of a patient's condition, recorded by TCM practitioners using unique TCM terminology during consultation. They are personalized and lack standardized forms, making them more complex than Western medical records. TCM intelligence aims to learn from the diagnostic experiences of predecessors using advanced technological means. Therefore, using deep learning methods to perform named entity recognition on TCM medical records is of great significance for the development of TCM. In this paper, to addresses the poor comprehension ability of existing named entity recognition models for TCM texts, we propose the model combined by bidirectional encoder from Transformers, Multi-head Attention, bidirectional long-short memory, fusion and conditional random field (BERT-BiLSTM-MHA-FUSION-CRF) based on the BERT-BiLSTM-CRF model by introducing the multi-head attention mechanism and multiple fusion layers. In this model, BERT is used to encode and learn from the input text, passing the word vector sequence to the BiLSTM layer to extract multiple local features of the text. The MHA is then utilized to enhance the model's ability to capture different contextual information. As BERT and BiLSTM focus on different feature scales, the outputs from the BERT layer and the MHA are fused again to enrich the semantic sequence features, thereby making the CRF decoding predictions more accurate. We evaluate our method on CCKS2017, CCKS2019, CLUENER, and our self-built TCM medical records dataset TCMYIAN, compared to the current SOTA methods, our approach achieved accuracy improvements of 2.7 %, 2.38 %, 1.2 %, and 0.79 %, respectively.","Engineering, Biomedical",A method of named entity recognition in traditional Chinese medical cases by integrating BERT and BiLSTM,,[]

A potential framework is provided by extended position-based dynamics (XPBD). However, current approaches frequently struggle to achieve real-time performance, high precision, and numerical stability all at once, which restricts their capacity to generate high-fidelity results. With an emphasis on use in pulmonary fibrosis, this work suggests a novel, optimized XPBD technique designed to overcome these drawbacks. The proposed method introduces three key enhancements to the traditional XPBD framework. First, during the initialization stage, an adaptive initial value strategy is introduced to compensate for external force terms, thereby aligning the simulation's starting position more closely with the ground-truth solution and improving deformation accuracy. Second, to improve the stability of the deformation process, constraint formulations based on the isoparametric element principle are used in the constraint-solving stage to transfer the deformation computation to a common reference coordinate system. Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is finally incorporated for reduced-order prediction at the state evolution stage, speeding up the deformation process. Nonlinear fidelity is maximally preserved by this separation of the core solution process from the time scale of reduced-order prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method realistically simulates the deformation of fibrotic lung tissue, exhibiting significant advantages in terms of real-time performance, accuracy, and stability. Additionally, the method's usefulness and potential for clinical integration in medical simulations are shown by the good feedback provided by cooperating surgeons.","Engineering, Biomedical",Effective simulation of nonlinear soft tissue deformation for interactive medical applications: An enhanced XPBD technique,,[]

Timely detection and effective treatment significantly improve patient outcomes and life expectancy. MRI images are commonly used in clinical settings for non-invasive brain tumor detection. Classifying various brain tumor types is challenging due to their diverse characteristics. Deep learning (DL) models have been applied to classify brain tumors, but their accuracy still faces challenges due to complexity. This paper introduces ShallowMRI, a lightweight CNN model for classifying brain tumor categories in MRI images. The model features an innovative attention mechanism that improves its ability to focus on relevant features for accurate classification. Erosion and dilation techniques are used to identify optimal contours, removing unnecessary regions. Additionally, Local Binary Patterns (LBP) enhance image preprocessing by reducing computational costs and optimizing feature extraction. ShallowMRI's performance is evaluated against pre-trained models and existing methods using three benchmark datasets: Kaggle Multiclass, BR35H Binary, and Histogram Binary. The results show that ShallowMRI outperforms other models with accuracies of 98.24 %, 98.16 %, and 99.70 %, respectively, for the three datasets.

Although music therapy is promising for AD, most studies use static analysis and overlook the timevarying nature of sound and brain responses. Therefore, this study used EEG-based dFC analysis and Phase Lag Index (PLI) to assess neural responses of healthy controls (HC), mild AD, and severe AD patients during a 60second Jasmine Flower music stimulus, focusing on the climax phase (20-45 s). A time-weighted dynamic network integrating time distance, path strength, and path number was constructed, and a novel Time-Global Weighted Efficiency (TGWE) metric was proposed to quantify compensatory mechanisms. Results showed enhanced prefrontal-parietal connectivity and improved global efficiency in AD patients during the climax, approaching HC levels. Network metrics under music stimulation correlated positively with MMSE scores (p < 0.01). Mild AD patients-maintained path number but showed reduced path strength, while severe AD patients exhibited deterioration across all parameters; TGWE correlated with disease severity (R2 = 0.55, p = 0.0056). Findings highlight music climax as a modulator of dFC and introduce a time-weighted framework for assessing spatiotemporal brain network plasticity in AD.","Engineering, Biomedical",Impact of musical stimulation versus resting-state on dynamic functional connectivity in Alzheimer's patients: a time-weighted network modeling study,,[]

However, achieving finer-grained, emotion-specific spatial partitioning in the 2D EEG representation and effectively integrating local-to-global information remain significant challenges. To address these limitations, we propose the Hierarchical Spatial-Frequency Bi-Patch Mamba (HSF-BPM) network - a novel framework to adapt Mamba's state-space modeling for 2D EEG spatial pattern analysis. Our framework incorporates: (1) a Channel-wise Frequency Encoder (CFE) utilizing Fully Connected Networks (FCN) to model inter-frequency relationships and enhance spectral information per electrode; (2) a Local Spatial Feature Extractor (LSFE) combining dynamic convolution with Selective Kernel Networks (SKNet) to capture multi-scale, emotion-specific brain activity patterns; and (3) a Global Spatial Feature Extractor (GSFE) built upon the Mamba network with bidirectional patch partitioning to model full 2D spatial relationships in EEG data. Extensive experiments on SEED, SEED-IV and DEAP datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Our in-depth analysis has further identified the core collaborative mechanisms among all components, with particular emphasis on the pivotal role of the Mamba network within the architecture. The results demonstrate the superiority of our biologically inspired, Mamba-driven hierarchical approach in EEG emotion recognition, establishing a theoretical and methodological foundation for both affective computing and broader cognitive state recognition using EEG.

While other unconventional electrode configurations have also been sometimes used in the literature, there are limited works on how these compare to the conventional configuration. Hence, the main contribution of this work is to analyse the flexibility in the electrode placement for EOG-based gaze estimation. Specifically, the gaze displacement estimation (GDE) performance obtained using different single-bipolar-channel and two-bipolar-channel configurations was analysed, and, in the case of the latter, the GDE performance was statistically compared to that obtained using the conventional configuration. In contrast to other comparative works reported in the literature, this work carries out an exhaustive analysis by systematically analysing all the different configurations that may be computed from a setup with 16 electrodes attached at equiangular positions around the eyes. Furthermore, the eye movements were carried out systematically in isotropic directions, and the EOG dataset used in this work is also being made publicly available. The results obtained demonstrate that the conventional horizontal and vertical bipolar EOG channels are not the only configuration that could be used for EOG-based GDE, but there are various other configurations with two bipolar channels that yield a performance that is statistically equivalent or even better than that of the conventional configuration.","Engineering, Biomedical",A systematic quantitative analysis on bipolar channel selection for EOG-based gaze displacement estimation,,[]

Despite recent advancements, existing polyp segmentation models struggle with limited generalizability, inadequate long-range contextual understanding, and poor utilization of unlabeled data-hindering their robustness in diverse clinical settings. This research introduces a new Spatio-Channel Attentive Residual Encoding-Decoding Network (SCAR-EDN) for automated colorectal polyp segmentation, addressing the critical need for accurate and efficient detection in CRC prevention. To overcome the inherent complexities of medical image variability and the scarcity of annotated data, a sophisticated pipeline-based augmentation strategy was developed, curating eleven non-conflicting transformations across three distinct pipelines, thereby enhancing data diversity while preserving crucial anatomical realism. The core innovation, SCAR-EDN architecture, integrates a self-attention mechanism within a residual encoder-decoder framework, enabling the model to capture long-range dependencies and essential contextual information for precise delineation of colorectal polyp boundaries. To mitigate the limitations of relying solely on labeled data, a semi-supervised learning approach was implemented, employing pseudo-labeling and a consistency loss to ensure prediction stability across augmentations and improve generalization. The efficacy of semi-supervised SCAR-EDN was validated through comprehensive self and cross-dataset experiments across five diverse colonoscopy image datasets. Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on the augmented Kvasir-SEG dataset within a semi-supervised environment, SCAR-EDN achieved an accuracy of 0.9878, an Intersection over Union of 0.9526, and a Dice coefficient of 0.9620, all while maintaining a computationally efficient training time of 5,960 s.

It can lead to memory decline, brain atrophy, and ultimately death. The mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a transitional stage that may be progressive (pMCI), leading to AD, or stable (sMCI). Early AD diagnosis and MCI conversion are very crucial for timely treatment, slowing disease progression, and alleviating the financial burden on patients. Multimodal neuroimaging data offers complementary information and has been widely utilized to differentiate between AD and normal controls (NC), as well as to predict MCI conversion. Recent research has indicated that the inclusion of structural information could improve the performance of MCI conversion and AD diagnosis. Moreover, the pathological characteristics of AD have been demonstrated to be advantageous for its diagnosis. However, previous works only considered different ways to construct graphs to represent the structural information of samples and lacks efficient exploitation of structural information and AD pathological characteristics. In addition, the diagnostic accuracy of classifying MCI subtypes remains constrained. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for feature selection, targeting the identification of robust neuroimaging features from magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography data. Initially, we utilize the random forest method to calculate the similarity matrix for each modality. Subsequently, we integrate auxiliary data into the objective function and similarity information using the sparse regression method for feature selection. Then, we utilize the l2,1 norm regularization term to select the shared features from predictor data and auxiliary data. Lastly, we utilize a multi-kernel support vector machine to integrate multimodal data and perform classification tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on the ADNI dataset demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches, achieving classification accuracies of 80.87%, 80.36%, and 81.78% for pMCI vs. sMCI, MCI vs. NC, and MCI vs. AD, respectively.

However, the paucity of labelled data inhibits classification models' training. Researchers have turned to generative deep learning techniques alongside signal processing to augment existing data and improve cardiac auscultation classification models. However, the primary focus of prior studies has been on model performance rather than robustness. Robustness, in this case, is defined as both in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance by measures such as Matthew's correlation coefficient. One contribution of this work is to show that more robust abnormal heart sound classifiers can be trained using an augmented dataset. The augmented dataset includes both signal processing techniques and synthetic phonocardiograms conditionally generated using the WaveGrad and DiffWave diffusion models an approach that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first work of its kind. The efficacy of the proposed data augmentation approach is evaluated on an example convolutional neural network, trained on the original and augmented data. It is found that both the in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance can be improved over various datasets for neural networks trained with this augmented dataset. Results show significant performance improvements. Specifically, in-distribution accuracy, balanced accuracy, and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) increased by 2.5%, 4.1%, and 0.066, respectively.

We address two intrinsic challenges associated with the application of deep learning models to this task. The first one is the need of large databases annotated by expert medical staff. The second one is the presence of a strong class imbalance in the datasets primarily due to the predominance of non-pathological respiratory sounds. For overcoming these issues we propose a deep convolutional network model that is trained using the contrastive self-supervised learning paradigm. This technique is able to generate useful audio data representations from unlabeled data that can be effectively transferred to the target task employing a limited amount of annotated data. We have evaluated the developed systems on the well-known ICBHI dataset that contains respiratory cycles categorized into four different classes. Results show that our approach outperforms the conventional supervised learning model when the size of available labeled data is reduced.

So, the curvature analysis is regarded as an effective tool for determining the severity of AIS. However, previous X-ray based Cobb angle calculations primarily focused on mild and moderate scoliosis cases, and it is undeniable that X-ray imaging is typically acquired for presurgical cases suffering from severe spine curves to avoid unnecessary ionizing radiation exposure. So, in this paper, an end-to-end system is developed for accurate spine curvature estimation from spine 3D X-ray images.

Then, the vertebral region is segmented using a hybrid UDANet model, which is the combination of a hybrid U-net with a dilated convolutional layer and decoder attention module. The challenges of the learning process are addressed by utilizing the Inverse Polynomial Linear Unit (IpLU) activation function, which is augmented with adjustable parameters for controlling the gradient slope. From the segmental vertebral data, the vertebral compression ratio (VCR) is estimated for curvature evaluation. Finally, the Segmentation Coordinates based on the Cobb Angle Network (SCANet) is proposed for Cobb angle measurement to improve detection accuracy.

Although existing studies have employed EEG microstates or spectral characteristics to identify ASD, the millisecond-scale nonlinear transition patterns of microstate sequences and their spectral dynamics have been neglected. This has led to the inadequate sensitivity and interpretability of current biomarkers. Methods: This study sought to characterize the neurophysiological dynamics of ASD and evaluate the diagnostic value of a novel hybrid approach integrating EEG microstate analysis with Chaos Game Representation (CGR) and Frequency CGR (FCGR) as electrophysiological biomarkers. It applied two public EEG datasets (the University of Sheffield databases and the King Abdulaziz University) for performance comparison and better generalizability. Microstate features were extracted via the EEGLAB toolbox. Microstate sequences were then transformed into two dimension spatial patterns using CGR, from which spectral and time-frequency features were derived. Results: For ASD, there is a reduction in the stability and engagement of microstate C, as well as abnormal dynamic transitions among specific networks (the visual, attention, salience, and semantic networks). There are characteristics such as enhanced high-frequency neural oscillatory activities(Root Mean Square Frequency, RMSF), increased spectral dispersion(Centre Frequency, CF; Root Variance Frequency, RVF), and reduced overall power. Machine learning models based on CGR time-frequency features achieved 95% accuracy in classifying patients with ASD. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that the hybrid EEG microstate-CGR/FCGR approach reveals distinctive neurodynamic alterations in ASD and holds significant promise as a potential diagnostic biomarker.","Engineering, Biomedical",Diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder using EEG microstates and chaos game representation,,[]

However, enhancing the quality of tumor segmentation and delineating precise tumor boundaries are immense challenges for effective diagnosis and treatment planning. To address these challenges, we propose a new model called SWATT U-Net that utilizes a Semi-Wavelet Attention (SWATT) module within the U-Net architecture. SWATT incorporates a semi-wavelet layer and its inverse, enabling multi-resolution analysis of input images by scaling the original image to focus on specific parts.

Regarding the initial learning stage, a position feature fusion module is proposed to capture and enhance spatial positional feature representation of kidney stones at the feature level, encouraging the model to treat these features as key determinants in the decision-making process. Regarding the incremental learning stage, a decision distillation loss is proposed to align the internal and external decision logic at the decision level, guiding the model to explore the decision logic that adapts to new view data based on the old view knowledge. Experiments conducted on a transverse dataset with 9401 images and a coronal dataset with 1799 images demonstrate that the proposed framework has achieved 12.96% incremental and forgetting rate, outperforming the well-performing LwF model by +5.49%.

First, chest X-ray images are fed into the encoder to generate parameters for constructing the Dirichlet distribution. Then, the Dirichlet distribution is sampled to obtain latent variable. Finally, the latent variable is fed into the decoder to output the prediction of the chest X-ray. The ablation experiments not only confirm that the proposed loss function can improve the model performance, but also verify that the complexity and performance of the model can be balanced by changing the internal parameters. The results of classification experiments on three chest X-ray datasets show that the complexity and performance of DirVIB are better than the related models compared in this paper, which suggests that DirVIB is more suitable for the classification of chest X-ray images, which provides a new strategy for medical image classification.","Engineering, Biomedical",Dirichlet variational information bottleneck: A flexible model for chest X-ray classification,,[]

Deep Learning (DL) replicas have exposedpossible in medical imaging tasks; however, they can have difficulty predicting DMEs due to data shortages, processing resources, and comprehension issues. An attention-based weighted Gated Recurrent Units (AB-WGRU) model is proposed for predicting DME using OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) imaging data. The AB-WGRU model combines weighted Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) with attention mechanisms to capture local and global contextual information from OCT images. Due to data redundancy and noise, the obtained OCT images require pre-processing using filtered data. This indicates that the filtering process employs the 2D Fourier transform (2DFT). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to extract pertinenttopographies from the improved data, and Modified Genetic Algorithms (MGA) are employed to produce the best combination of features. The proposed technique demonstrates performance across several evaluation metrics. Specifically, it obtains an accuracy of 0.98, precision of 0.98, recall of 0.98, and F-measure of 0.98. The AB-WGRU model outperforms existing methods.

However, 4D CBCT images suffer from severe artifacts due to the extremely sparse projection data. This study aims to develop a novel spatiotemporal structure-aware neural network capable of generating high quality 4D CBCT images. Methods: We proposed a Spatial and Temporal Adaptation based Model (STAM), which fine-tunes the image encoder of a pre-trained SAM model by incorporating Adapter modules in both spatial and temporal branches.

However, we need slower scanning speeds to obtain high-quality images, which often introduce noise and sample drift, causing distortion. In addition, the large-scale scanning of high-resolution images by AFM consumes a lot of sample resources and time. Although the traditional bicubic method can achieve the generation of high-resolution images, it cannot restore the details of the image well, and even the obtained image is basically different from the original high-resolution image. Here, in this paper, we propose a fast imaging method that combines the scanning data acquisition and the image super-resolution algorithm of the deep learning model, which can quickly generate high-quality images with little noise interference and small drift.

It's very important to have an early diagnosis because untreated illnesses that could be cancerous can lead to mouth cancer. The lack of personal monitoring tools makes it even more clear that we need smart diagnostic systems. We came up with the Meta-SAM model (MetaAcon Separable Attention Model), a new deep learning architecture that is meant to help in classifying the MOD (Mouth and Oral Diseases) dataset. This proposed model adds some architectural improvements that are primarily meant to fix the main problems with classic Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), especially when it comes to classifying medical images in excessive detail, including finding mouth and oral diseases (MOD). Also, standard CNNs can be very difficult to compute, which makes them hard to scale and use in real time. To solve these limitations, the model used depth-wise separable convolutional layers. This reduced the number of parameters and the cost of computation by breaking standard CNNs down into depth and point operations. Also, a custom MetaAcon activation function is utilized because standard MetaAcon still has some problems, such as limiting how flexible it can become in terms of representation. Custom MetaAcon is a learnable activation function that adaptively highlights important features while ignoring unimportant ones. It solves problems like bad feature selectivity and noise in medical images. With a blending value of 0.9, the improved MetaAcon combines adaptability with smooth gradient learning, making learning more stable and efficient. Thus, it speeds up convergence, stops gradients from vanishing, and makes deep feature representation stronger, which is very important for accurate MOD classification. Also, standard CNNs sometimes have problems with vanishing gradients and losing features in deeper layers. Residual connections assist solves these problems by making gradient flow more stable and speeding up convergence. Standard CNNs also treat all features the same, which can mean that important diagnostic clues are missed. To fix this, the model uses squeeze-and-excitation (SE) blocks to show how important each channel is. It also uses self-attention with many heads to find long-range and spatial relationships, which helps make up for CNNs' restricted ability to take in information. The suggested model gets 99.7% of the classifications right, which is better than the usual CNN (96.2%).and demonstrates its effectiveness in diagnosing complex oral diseases.

To address this, we rigorously assess five distinct validation schemes-such as random cross-validation (RCV), K-fold cross-validation (KCV), leave-one-subject-out (LOSO), subject-wise classification (SWC), and cross-session validation (CSV)-using a 1D-CNN model and a cross-session mental workload dataset. The results revealed a notable performance gap of approximately 20 % between SWC (37.50 %) and CSV (35.58 %) compared to RCV (57.34 %), KCV (55.47 %), and LOSO (58.59 %), highlighting the impact of limited training data in the SWC and CSV schemes, where only single subjects' data is used. Transfer learning was employed to further evaluate the cross-dataset transferability, the trained 1D-CNN model was frozen, two new dense layers were appended, and the model was trained on another COG-BCI dataset. This transfer learning approach significantly improved performance, achieving an accuracy of 99.94 %. Furthermore, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis was performed to interpret the model and identify the most important channels contributing to the model's performance. The novelty of this work lies in proposed deep learning framework that not only achieves high classification performance but also offers interpretability through the SHAP analysis and generalizability across datasets by transfer learning.","Engineering, Biomedical",Investigation of various validation and testing schemes for classification of cross-session mental workload to match real-life expectations of BCI: A transfer learning and XAI approach,,[]

This is primarily due to the heterogeneity and complexity of breast lesions, along with the substantial imaging data provided by each sequence of MRI. These factors place high demands on the expertise of clinicians, and the processing of extensive MRI scans is both costly and prone to error. Different sequence MRI reveals diverse characteristics of the lesions, and joint analysis of multi-sequence data has greater diagnostic value for breast cancer. In recent years, some studies have attempted to employ deep learning methods for multi-sequence MRI fusion to enhance diagnostic performance. However, existing approaches often lack robust strategies for feature learning that are specifically tailored to the distinct characteristics of each sequence MRI. Additionally, they have not fully leveraged the relevant information from multi-sequence MRI during modeling, limiting the effectiveness of the model. Inspired by the diagnostic workflow of radiologists, an Attention-driven Feature Learning and Fusion (AFLF) framework was proposed to classify benign and malignant breast lesions using multi-sequence MRI. Our framework employs an attention-based encoding network to learn attention-aware representations for each sequence MRI, enabling the model to focus on the unique lesion characteristics in each sequence. Furthermore, an adaptive attention learning fusion module facilitates the interaction and fusion of these representations, ensuring the relevance and representativeness of the features from different sequences are fully leveraged to achieve efficient breast cancer diagnosis.

Deep learning-based categorization of brain tumors using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has emerged as a vital research area. This paper introduces an automated deep learning model and an optimal information fusion framework for brain tumor classification from MRI images. The dataset used in this study was imbalanced, posing a significant challenge for training deep learning models, as it biases classifier performance toward the majority class.

However, the statistical distributions of EMG show high inter-person variability, making cross-subject interpretation unreliable. Calibration phases with guided exercises are currently used in commercial devices to address this issue. Modern solutions rely on unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods which align the sample distributions of different subjects without requiring tedious calibration exercises. However, when a real concept shift occurs (e.g. a similar signal pattern corresponds to different gestures in different subjects), these alignment methods are inefficient. This paper presents a novel linear and shallow UDA method based on Linear Discriminant Analysis and K-Means to address cross-subject calibration. To better handle real concept shifts, this parsimonious and easy-to-use method is non-conservative, meaning that it relies only on target samples and initial pseudo-labels rather than performing domain alignment.

Particularly, we first project rays at specific angles from the geometric center of the blood pool in each frame, intersecting with the endocardium and epicardium. Subsequently, we represent the myocardial motion features based on the displacement and curvature of intersection points relative to the geometric center point in different frames. To further explore the motion features, we introduce a Multi-Orientated Spatio-Temporal Multi-Layer Perception (MOST-MLP) for myocardial motion encoding. The proposed MOST-MLP is evaluated on one private dataset comprising 450 subjects and public datasets (ACDC and M&Ms), with its strong performance across these benchmarks demonstrating method's effectiveness and superiority. Our code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/ gaoningn/MOST-MLP to facilitate reproducibility and further research.","Engineering, Biomedical",Deep relative motion analysis for the identification and phenotyping of scarred myocardium using cine-MRI,,[]

Deep learning (DL) methodologies have shown considerable promise in BC diagnosis utilizing histopathological images; nonetheless, the impact of image magnification and magnification fusion on model efficacy remains inadequately investigated. This study resolves this deficiency by performing an exhaustive assessment of twenty sophisticated DL architectures, comprising ten Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and ten Vision Transformers (ViTs), employing two datasets: BreakHis, which encompasses images at various magnifications (40x, 100x, 200x, and 400 x ), and BACH, which concentrates on a singular magnification (200 x ). The approach includes two categorization scenarios: individual image magnification and image magnification fusion. Our results indicate that image magnification fusion improves performance in binary (malignant vs. benign) and multiclass classification relative to higher image magnifications (200 x and 400 x ) for the majority of models. Nonetheless, lower magnifications, especially 40x, generally attained greater accuracy, indicating their appropriateness for DL-based BC identification. Our methodology, which compares single image magnifications with image magnification fusion, surpassed earlier research that was restricted to either individual or fused magnifications. Utilizing the BreakHis dataset, the top-performing models attained 100 % accuracy in binary classification and 97.00 % in multi-class classification with ViT structures, confirming their superiority over CNNs. Using the BACH dataset, Tiny ViT-21 m outperformed CNN with a multi-class classification accuracy of 96.25 %. These findings highlight the significance of incorporating magnification parameters in DL model building and indicate that lesser magnifications, such as 40x, may yield optimal performance.

Effectiveness of classification models is still limited by the challenges associated with managing high-dimensional medical datasets, despite advancements in machine learning. Traditional feature selection strategies are often ineffective due to the data dimensionality and complexity. This study improves feature selection and classification accuracy in cardiovascular disease datasets by utilising the Mayfly Algorithm (MA), a novel meta-heuristic optimisation technique inspired by mayfly mating behaviour. The MA is used in the study to find the best features using five real-time cardiovascular datasets. The chosen features are evaluated using classifiers such as Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Traditional optimization techniques, including Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO), and Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO), are examined and contrasted.

One of the impactful stages in MI-based EEG neurofeedback is the selection of EEG channels so that this small number of channels contains important information relevant to movement. It is preferable for these channels to have common features of both MI and ME. By considering this assumption in healthy subjects, it is possible to identify channels that can also be utilized in patients, leading to ME after treatment. Therefore, investigating the relationship between these two modalities can assist in selecting channels for neurofeedback treatment and provide a deeper understanding of the neural network mechanism underlying these motor activities. In this study, twelve effective connections, named SC, are selected using multivariate Granger causality (MVGC). They are obtained between subjects with a repetition threshold level of 80%, using EEG signal with 29 physiology-based channels of 109 healthy subjects from the Physionet dataset, during upper limb MI/ME. Subsequently, the MVGC values of ME are estimated using the corresponding MI values of the SCs through regression analysis. Finally, 4 of these SCs showed the best results in terms of R2 and rho (regression parameters) for estimated and observed MVGC values of ME, which led to the selection of 6 effective channels.

Although attention-based methods have shown promising results, they often fail to effectively capture global context, potentially leading to the omission of subtle yet clinically significant findings. Furthermore, Transformer-based frameworks frequently suffer from high computational complexity, which hinders their deployment in clinical environments. Additionally, existing approaches incorporating disease labels via multi-label classification are typically limited to binary outputs, failing to model disease severity and inter-symptom dependencies. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we introduce a novel framework for automated radiology report generation that integrates graph-guided disease-symptom modeling with multi-level context fusion. Our approach introduces a graph-structured topic classifier that explicitly captures semantic correlations among disease-related topics. To improve efficiency and modeling capacity, we replace the traditional Transformer encoder with a Mamba-based encoder, which better captures long-range dependencies and ambiguous pathological features. Furthermore, a multi-level context fusion decoder is proposed to proficiently combine global and local visual representations for accurate and coherent report generation. Extensive evaluations on the IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR benchmark datasets reveal that our approach reliably surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both natural language generation and clinical efficacy metrics. Notably, our model achieves relative improvements of 3.68% (precision), 3.80% (recall), and 3.88% (F1-score) in Clinical Efficacy (CE) metrics, highlighting its strong potential for practical deployment in medical reporting applications.","Engineering, Biomedical",Graph-guided topic modeling and multi-level context-aware framework for automated radiology report generation,,[]

First, to effectively capture local features of brain structures at different scales, three different convolutions are adopted to extract different types of features, including fine-grained features, lightweight channel features and large-scale contextual information. To further establish the global dependencies of deep features, Swin Transformer is embedded into the bottleneck module. Finally, the deformation field can be accurately estimated by comprehensively utilizing global and local features. Extensive experimental results on the OASIS, LPBA40, and IXI MRI brain datasets show that our model achieves an average improvement in registration accuracy of over 5.68%, 2.4%, and 6.69%, respectively.

To enable more intelligent and efficient robotic surgery, it is crucial for machines to understand the surgical scene from intraoperative X-ray images. However, this task faces several challenges. Firstly, interventional instruments are difficult to distinguish due to their similar appearance and elongated structures. Secondly, most existing methods focus on endoscopic videos with higher resolution and clearer instruments, while ignoring the noisy X-ray images. Lastly, unlike humans, current approaches lack the confidence assessment of predicted results, reducing the reliability of intelligent systems. In this paper, we propose an evidential surgical scene understanding network (Evi-SSUNet) to achieve accurate and reliable scene understanding. This multi-task network performs both surgical step recognition and target instrument segmentation. To enhance the reliability of step recognition, we introduce a confidence estimation (CE) module based on evidential deep learning to assess the confidence of the predictions and improve performance by constraining uncertainty. Moreover, we design a confidence-gated class attention (CCA) module that generates a dynamic class attention map related to specific surgical steps, which helps highlight target locations for more precise segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Evi-SSUNet surpasses other state-of-the-art methods in classification, segmentation, and multi-task learning, providing a significant advancement in the development of intelligent and trusted surgical robots for vascular interventions.","Engineering, Biomedical",Evi-SSUNet: A multi-task network for reliable surgical scene understanding in X-ray images,,[]

This study aimed to develop and evaluate a machine learning (ML) algorithm capable of forecasting CBT, as well as predicting fever and hypothermia, several hours in advance. Methods: We conducted a multicenter retrospective observational study in three mixed intensive care units (ICUs): two university hospitals in France (Hopital de la Timone and Nord), and one teaching military hospital in France (Sainte-Anne). We evaluated several prediction methods, including Neural Networks, Gradient Boosting, Random Forests, linear regression models, LSTM, and XGBoost. Inputs consisted of past temperature measurements, blood pressure, heart rate, and time of day. Results: Data from 10,189 ICU patients were analyzed. A training cohort (n = 5,146) from two ICUs was used to develop the models, and an independent evaluation cohort (n = 5,043) from the third ICU was used for testing. XGBoost consistently demonstrated the highest predictive performance for both fever and hypothermia. Sensitivity for fever (and hypothermia) prediction was 93.2 % (90.2 %) at 1 h, 86.6 % (82.3 %) at 2 h, and 76.8 % (70.3 %) at 4 h. Prediction of CBT values yielded Root Mean Square Errors of 0.19 degrees C, 0.31 degrees C, and 0.46 degrees C at 1, 2, and 4 h, respectively. Conclusion: This is the first large multicenter study to evaluate the contribution of ML to CBT prediction in ICU patients.

Early detection is critical to management. Neurodegenerative diseases provide obstacles due to their progressive nature, unknown origins and difficulty in early detection. In this Manuscript, early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases using temporal inductive path neural network in medical imaging (NDD-TIPNN) is proposed. Initially, the input images are collected from the Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's Progression (ADPP) dataset. The collected images are then processed using Confidence Partitioning Sampling Filtering (CPSF) to remove image artifacts. The pre-processed image is subsequently fed into the Temporal Inductive Path Neural Network (TIPNN) for the classification of neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and Healthy control. Generally, TIPNN does not show adopting optimization approaches to define the weight domains needed for accurate classification. Therefore, the Secretary Bird Optimization Algorithm (SBOA) is used to optimize the weight parameter of TIPNN which accurately classifies neurodegenerative diseases. The proposed NDD-TIPNN approach contains 99.19% higher accuracy, 99.43% higher sensitivity and 99.23% higher precision related to existing methods, like Spatially informed Bayesian neural network for neurodegenerative diseases classification (SBNN-NDC), Comparative analysis of machine learning algorithms for multi-syndrome classification of neurodegenerative syndromes (CNS-SVM) and Neurodegenerative diseases-Caps: a capsule network based early screening system for the classification of neurodegenerative diseases (CND-CNN) respectively.

,0,2026-02-01,BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL,"The teacher-student network is a useful learning method and has been increasingly applied to fulfill semi-supervised medical image segmentation. However, in the face of the limited labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data, how to adequately consider the discrepancy between teacher and student networks, as well as greatly guarantee their consistency through learning, is always a big challenge. To overcome this challenge, a so-called Competitive Grouped teacher-student Network (CGTS-Net) is proposed, which integrates the stability of pseudo-label generation in the conventional mean teacher framework with the discrepancy learning through a cross-network correction mechanism. Specifically, the CGTS-Net adopts a dual-branch network architecture, where each subnet group maintains the quality of the pseudo labels of the teacher network within the group through the exponential moving average method. Between groups, a dynamic competition strategy is developed for cross-group knowledge transfer, that is, the teacher network from the better-performing subnet group provides pseudo-supervision signals to the student network of the other group. To alleviate the distribution shift between labeled and unlabeled data, a cross-group and copy-paste enhancement strategy is proposed, which dynamically merges the real labels and pseudo-labeled data from the dual-branch network, effectively mitigating the distribution discrepancy. For the purpose of tackling the widespread boundary ambiguity in medical images, an edge-aware consistency loss function is designed to enhance the prediction consistency of segmentation boundaries, improving the model's ability to discern fine structures. Finally, experiments conducted on four datasets (LA, Pancreas, KiTS, and LiTS) show that the proposed CGTS-Net method outperforms current state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods in both segmentation accuracy and boundary prediction ability.","Engineering, Biomedical",CGTS-Net: Competitive grouped teacher-student network for semi-supervised medical image segmentation,,[]

This study aims to identify the factors influencing the efficacy of subcutaneous specific immunotherapy (SCIT) for AR in children and to develop a predictive model for treatment outcomes using machine learning techniques. Data were collected from 272 children aged 4-15 years with AR, excluding those with asthma, who underwent more than three years of mite SCIT at two hospitals in southern Zhejiang. Patients were categorized into effective and ineffective groups based on the improvement in the Combined Symptom Medication Score (CSMS) before and after treatment. The data were split into a training set and a testing set, and the bIRSCA algorithm was applied to identify optimal feature subsets in the training set. The selected features were then used in a support vector machine (SVM) model to assess performance on the testing set, with ten-fold cross-validation applied to evaluate the model. The final results were based on the average performance metrics across ten iterations. The bIRSCA-SVM model identified key biomarkers, including the sIgE/tIgE (Der p) ratio, sIgE (Der p), eosinophil count, eosinophil ratio, and the sIgE/tIgE (Der f) ratio, as significant predictors of therapeutic efficacy. The model achieved an accuracy of 88.992 %, sensitivity of 99.736 %, and specificity of 86.872 %, outperforming other models.

Although deep learning has recently shown great promise in this field, current methods still face key challenges: transformer-based models often achieve high-quality reconstruction but suffer from high computational cost due to their quadratic time complexity, while CNN-based models, lacking global context modeling, struggle to deliver satisfactory image quality. To address these limitations, we propose a novel CT image super-resolution framework called MambaCT, which introduces the Mamba state space model into this domain. Leveraging Mamba's linear time complexity and inherent global attention capabilities, we design two core modules: the State Space Module (SSM), which uses a lightweight asymmetric dual-branch architecture for efficient long-range dependency modeling, and the State Space Block (SSB), which integrates SSM and convolution operations within a dual-path residual framework to flexibly fuse local and global features. Experimental results demonstrate that MambaCT achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple public datasets. Specifically, on the ADNI-4C dataset at x4 scale, it achieves the largest PSNR improvement of 1.60% over the second-best method. On the COVID-CT dataset at x3 scale, it yields the highest SSIM improvement of 1.61% and the greatest LPIPS reduction of 20.5%. Moreover, due to its linear complexity, MambaCT significantly reduces runtime and memory usage. For an input size of 120, GPU memory consumption is only 9.6 GB, which is 1.2 GB less than SRFBN and significantly lower than the transformer-based ViT-B model.

EEG signals, being non-invasive measurements, are among the signals that most accurately represent human emotions. Nevertheless, the abundance of channels in EEG signals leads to heightened computational complexity and a greater risk of overfitting the model. In this research, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) was employed to choose the suitable EEG channel, and a unique model named convolutional block attention module - long shortterm memory - attention module (CBAM-LSTM-Attention) was introduced for emotion recognition. The model combines residual blocks, LSTM networks, and attention mechanisms to efficiently incorporate important channel-spatial and temporal domain features of EEG signals. To achieve high prediction accuracy in emotion recognition, the following innovations can be implemented: (i) Integrating XGBoost algorithm to evaluate each channel based on power spectral density (PSD), and selecting the channel with the highest score as the input for the model. This approach reduces the computational complexity of the model and minimises the risk of overfitting. (ii) Introducing a channel-spatial attention module in the residual block to enhance the model's ability to extract channel-spatial domain features in the convolutional block attention module (CBAM) model. (iii) Utilising a multi-head attention mechanism to improve the model's capability to extract temporal domain features, enabling global feature perception and input to the LSTM layer for decoding. The results indicated that the proposed CBAM-LSTM-Attention model achieved 95.108 % accuracy for arousal and 94.862 % for valence on the DEAP dataset using single-channel data. Using multi-channel data, the model achieved 98.790 % for arousal and 97.249 %for valence.

However, most of the parameters measured by existing monitoring devices are fixed absolute metrics, overlooking significant individual variation feedback metrics such as thoracic cross-sectional area. To address this, we propose a non-contact CPR quality monitoring method based on a depth camera, which measures compression depth, rate, and changes in the patient's thoracic cross-sectional area in real time. The method first uses the depth camera to create a spatial point cloud and track the compression position, then calculates the monitoring parameters based on depth changes in the point cloud within the region of interest. Experiments conducted in different scenarios demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, experiments on CPR manikins of different body sizes reveal that the same level of compression results in different compression effects depending on the body size, suggesting that personalized compression strategies may improve the success rate of resuscitation in real-world scenarios.

They often rely on additional data, such as white light endoscopy (WLE) and EUS text reports, to aid in the diagnosis. Unfortunately, in practice, these supplementary modalities are sometimes overlooked during patient evaluation. To address these issues, we propose the Cross-modal Feature Reconstruction Network (CFRN), which integrates multimodal data modeling for medical diagnostic processes and performs specific learning for different modalities with missing data.

Compared to traditional CNN methods, Transformers have excellent global context information extraction capabilities. However, using a purely Transformer-based architecture for image segmentation not only increases the overall network parameters but also decreases the ability to extract local features. The accurate extraction and integration of local and global features are crucial for achieving medical image segmentation.

Reduced cardiac output (CO) is frequently associated with CVD. Thus, accurate measurement of CO aids its diagnosis and helps to guide treatment. A convenient, real-time, noninvasive way to estimate CO is the Pressure Recording Analytic Method (PRAM). It is based on the non-invasive detection of the pressure wave in a peripheral artery and does not require invasive measurements to calibrate the model parameters. Unfortunately, its accuracy is limited due to its dependence on the patient's height, weight, heart rate, and the mechanical properties of each individual's arteries. Furthermore, compared to the peripheral arterial pressure wave, the aortic pressure wave provides a more accurate and efficient means of estimating CO. Therefore, to improve the accuracy of the original PRAM method, this study incorporates height, weight, and heart rate measurements, as well as an AutoRegressive with eXogenous input (ARX) model, enabling adaptive estimation of the aortic pressure waveform from radial artery pressure wave measurement.

This study proposes a deep learning-based solution to automate the classification of harmful brain activities such as seizures, using EEG spectrograms. This study aims to automate seizure detection by leveraging deep learning techniques for classifying harmful brain activities using EEG spectrograms. The proposed method utilizes the HMS EEG dataset sourced from Kaggle, comprising expert-annotated EEG recordings categorized into six classes: Seizure, LPD, GPD, GRDA, LRDA, and Others. To improve model performance and generalization, a carefully designed preprocessing pipeline is employed: (1) Non-overlapping training protocol ensures that each EEG ID appears only once in the training data, preventing data leakage and ensuring that the model does not learn from multiple crops of the same EEG recording. (2) Logarithmic transformation and normalization reduce dynamic range variations and standardize data distribution. (3) Multimodal integration converts EEG signals into spectrograms, creating an 8-channel input representation for richer spatial and temporal feature extraction. (4) Data augmentation using horizontal flipping increases model robustness against variations in EEG recordings. We fine-tune an EfficientNet-B0 model, originally trained on ImageNet, by modifying the input layers and replacing the classification head with a Softmax-based six-class output layer.

Existing deep learning-based seizure prediction networks struggle to capture the temporal information of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals while effectively integrating spatial information. To overcome these limitations, we propose a memory cached vision transformer with Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN-MemViT) for seizure prediction. Our model employs a spatial information block (SI-block) and a CNN module to integrate the spatial information of EEG signals. Subsequently, a multi-layer memory cached encoder (MCE) is utilized to capture the long-range temporal dependencies in the EEG signals. The hierarchical federation (HF) module further processes the information after each MCE layer to capture shortterm event dependencies. By combining both long-range and short-range dependencies, discriminative features are obtained. The Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) is then chosen as the classifier, enabling the model to thoroughly explore the characteristics of epileptic signals. Event-based patient-specific and cross-patient experiments are conducted on the CHB-MIT database. The patient-specific experiments achieve a sensitivity of 97.857%, a false positive rate of 0.028/h, and an AUC of 0.951. These results demonstrate the superior performance and strong potential of KAN-MemViT for accurate and reliable seizure prediction.","Engineering, Biomedical",KAN-MemViT: A memory cached vision transformer with Kolmogorov-Arnold network for seizure prediction,,[]

To address these challenges, we propose a novel fine-grained network (CDRFF-Net) with ordinal regression to diagnose the severity of NC using AS-OCT images. The network consists of a complemental discriminative region extractor (CDRE) block and a graph-enhanced feature fusion (GFF) module. Specifically, to fully exploit the features of discriminative regions, we propose the CDRE block to extract the most salient discriminative region features as well as those less obvious but equally important regional features, thereby obtaining complementary discriminative region features. Subsequently, the GFF module aggregates these two parts of features while avoiding redundant information, thus effectively fusing these features. Consequently, our network can focus on discriminative region features, thereby improving the classification accuracy of NC. Additionally, to fully utilize the ordinal nature of NC grading, we incorporate soft labels containing ordinal information between classes in the loss function, instead of the commonly used one-hot labels in NC grading. Experiments on a local clinical AS-OCT dataset and two public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.","Engineering, Biomedical",Complementary discriminative region feature fusion network with ordinal regression for fine-grained nuclear cataract grading in AS-OCT images,,[]

However, two critical challenges hinder its accuracy and generalization: noisy labels in datasets due to annotation errors or subjective judgments, and unique image characteristics such as multiscale textures and staining variations. This study aims to address these challenges by proposing a novel framework that combines noise-robust learning and feature-specific attention mechanisms. A noise-resistant algorithm integrating noisy sample self-screening and hard sample color normalization (NSS-HSCN) was proposed, along with a dual-stream spatial and texture attention (DSSTA) framework. In the NSS-HSCN stage, a self-screening network filtered out noisy samples, and hard samples were subjected to color normalization. The DSSTA framework utilized a multi-scale spatial attention module and a texture-enhanced attention module to extract and fuse features. Experiments were carried out on the Chaoyang and HITAFH datasets. The method outperformed other leading methods on both datasets. On the Chaoyang and HITAFH datasets, our method achieved 86.02% and 90.16% accuracy, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in all metrics. Grad-CAM visualization verified the model's ability to focus on target areas and extract valuable features.

Snoring is a key symptom of SA and can be used to develop a non-contact automatic SA detection method. However, due to inter-subject variability, the acoustic characteristics of snoring can vary significantly across individuals. This inter-subject variability poses a significant challenge for model generalization and often leads to degraded performance when applied to unseen subjects. To address this challenge, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation framework based on Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) and introduce a lightweight Subject-Invariant Feature Refiner (SIFR) module. A two-stage training strategy is adopted. In the first stage, we pretrain a feature extractor, which integrates CNN and Transformer Encoder, using snoring data of existing subjects to extract a generalized snoring feature representation. In the second stage, the pretrained feature extractor is frozen. The SIFR module is introduced and combined with adversarial training to conduct domain adaptation with a small amount of unlabeled data from new subjects. We evaluate the model performance on three main SA-related tasks: SA event detection, SA patient diagnosis, and Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) estimation. On the subject-independent dataset, our model achieves 74.24% accuracy in SA event detection and 83.59% accuracy in SA patient diagnosis. For AHI estimation, our model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 10.430 and a Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.86, indicating a strong correlation between the estimated and real AHI values.

In this paper, we argue that instead of statically dividing the model into three parts for one-shot segmentation, the entire model should dynamically focus on each of the three spatially-related tumor targets progressively, using their distinct features. To this end, we propose a novel Target-aware Self Region-prompting Network (TSRNet), the first framework to introduce prompt-based learning into brain tumor segmentation. TSRNet incorporates two key modules: (1) a Static-Task-Prompt (STP) that dynamically activates target-specific feature channels and spatial regions based on preset textual prompts, and (2) a Self-Region-Prompt (SRP) that progressively segments WT, TC, and ET by explicitly leveraging their natural inclusion relationships. Extensive experiments on two public datasets (BraTS2021 and BraTS2020) and an in-house clinical dataset (Xiehe) demonstrate that TSRNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. TSRNet achieves average Dice scores of 91.24%, 89.97%, and 88.41% on the three datasets, respectively, with fewer false positives in highly entangled subregions such as TC and ET.

Surrogate data were employed to ensure that the observed synchronization was physiological rather than random. The findings demonstrate statistically robust EEG-ECG synchronization within the delta, theta and alpha EEG bands across different brain sites. phase-phase coupling was stronger in scalp EEG than in intracranially recorded EEG signals.

However, commercially available sEMG armbands often exhibit limited hardware performance, constrained recognition capabilities, or come at a very high cost. To overcome these limitations, we present the alpha Armband, a high-performance wireless sEMG acquisition device. It features 16 recording channels, a 12-bit analog-to-digital converter, and an adjustable sampling rate of up to 2000 Hz per channel, covering a broad bandwidth of 2-1000 Hz. The device supports low-power Bluetooth communication, configurable acquisition parameters, and is cost-controlled at approximately 150 USD. To validate its performance, sEMG data were collected from the forearms of 25 subjects performing ten distinct hand gestures. Classification was evaluated using three algorithmic approaches: support vector machines (SVM), convolutional neural networks (CNN) based on time-domain features, and CNN based on spectrum-domain features. The alpha Armband achieved an overall classification accuracy of up to 87 % for the ten hand gestures, demonstrating robust signal quality and practical applicability.

Abnormal lung sounds are key indicators of lung diseases, and their analysis offers potential for early and accurate diagnosis. This study introduces a deep learning framework for diagnosing COPD using lung auscultation sounds, addressing challenges like imbalanced datasets and differential diagnosis. Methods: Lung sound recordings were obtained from the International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics and King Abdullah University Hospital databases. Preprocessing steps included resampling, denoising using the Butterworth filter and empirical mode decomposition, and extracting Mel spectrograms as features.

However, generating a large number of reliable control commands using a minimal number of electrodes remains a significant challenge. This study introduces a novel dual-movement classification strategy that utilizes sEMG signals from only three neck muscles-right trapezius, left trapezius, and left sternocleidomastoid-to generate nine distinct control commands. Data were collected from 29 able-bodied participants and one polio-affected individual with severe upper and lower limb impairments. The able-bodied participants were evaluated under subject-independent conditions, while the polio-affected participant was assessed under both subject-independent and subject-dependent settings to simulate real-world usage. The raw sEMG signals were decomposed using Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), and a Genetic Algorithm (GA) was applied for feature selection. A k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifier was used for classification. The proposed system achieved similar to 99 % accuracy using similar to 20 GA-selected features, compared to similar to 97 % using all 48 features. For the polio-affected participant, the system achieved 100 % accuracy under the subject-dependent method even without GA. With GA, it reached 100 % accuracy under both subject-dependent and independent conditions. These results demonstrate the system's efficiency, robustness, and generalizability.

Early detection facilitates timely medical interventions to effectively manage symptoms. The helical axis may aid in identifying early gait abnormalities in KOA. Despite this potential, no studies have examined the variability of the helical axis during gait in KOA patients compared to healthy individuals. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) provide a practical solution for capturing joint motion in clinical settings. This study investigates differences in helical axis variability during gait among KOA patients, healthy young adults, and healthy middle-aged adults using IMUs. Ten KOA patients, eleven healthy young controls, and ten healthy middle-aged controls participated in this study. Gait analysis was conducted on a 6-meter walkway with IMUs placed on the tibial tuberosity and lateral epicondyle of the femur. Helical axes were computed at 0.05-second intervals across four gait phases. Variability in axis orientation was quantified using standard deviations of spherical coordinate angles and mean deviations from the best-fitting plane. Statistical analyses were performed using the Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by posthoc tests where appropriate. KOA patients exhibited reduced helical axis variability during the stance phase compared to controls, reflecting stiffer knee joint movement rather than instability. This diminished variability could serve as a sensitive marker for early KOA detection and its functional progression.

Deep learning models based on CNN and Transformer have been widely applied in image segmentation. However, CNNs struggle with global information extraction due to their limited receptive field and insensitivity to low-frequency image information. Although transformer-based models excel in global feature extraction, their quadratic computational complexity limits their use in real-world medical applications. This paper proposes a hybrid CNN-SSM framework, which utilizes low-frequency information, as well as local and global information to boost the precision of segmentation while maintaining the model's linear complexity.

Pediatric image analysis introduces additional complexity due to the scarcity of data, noise, and growth-related anatomical variations, particularly in bone analysis, where bone structures evolve more slowly compared to other organs. This study aims to develop a segmentation model that scales across different age groups, reduces annotation effort, and ensures high accuracy, particularly in low-quality images. To address these challenges, we propose a segmentation pipeline (PedVision) that first uses a Region of Interest (ROI) network to identify relevant regions, followed by a foundation model that translates each region into meaningful instances. These instances are then mapped to segmentation classes through an instance classifier (IC) network. To initiate rounds of the training of ROI and IC networks, we developed a fast, semi-automated annotation framework that leverages foundation models to annotate a subset of images using an object-level approach. In subsequent rounds, a human discriminator selects promising predictions from the last round, which are fed by unseen data, progressively enriching the model's training dataset for further fine-tuning of the networks. The networks are expanded from low-parameter to high-parameter models across rounds, incorporating a curriculum learning approach to capture increasingly complex features. We evaluated PedVision on 552 hand X-ray images of children, retrieved from the publicly available Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) and Digital Hand Atlas (DHA) datasets, which represent a diverse range of ages and racial backgrounds. PedVision performed segmentation of 19 hand bones, grouped in five classes, and was compared against U-Net and DeepLabV3+ models using ResNet34 and ResNet101 backbones, as well as the SegFormer model with four different encoder variants.

Aiming at the problems of the existing OCTA retinal vessel segmentation algorithms, which have unclear edge contour and many breakpoints in the segmentation results, we propose a U-shaped architecture based on Gabor modulation coding for OCTA retinal vessel segmentation. To assist convolutional pathway to refine vessel edge contour information, we proposed a Gabor convolutional pathway with multiple scales, different orientations and fixed weights to modulate and encode feature maps of different sizes. Furthermore, considering the repair of breakpoints and the elimination of anomalies, we proposed an ON-OFF convolution combined with skip connections to extract the multi-level information. According to the experimental results on the OCTA-3 M, OCTA-6 M datasets, this model effectively extracts the edge contour information of blood vessels, reduces the vascular breakpoints, balances the accuracy and integrity of blood vessel segmentation, and achieves superior performance evaluation indicators overall compared with the existing optimal methods in the fundus OCTA retinal blood vessel segmentation task.","Engineering, Biomedical",U-shaped architecture based on Gabor modulation coding for OCTA retinal vessel segmentation,,[]

However, existing methods struggle to balance heart rate estimation accuracy with computational efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight LiteSyncNet model through a multidimensional feature enhancement strategy: Lite Fusion Stem (LFS) captures long-term temporal dependencies to suppress noise; structural reparameterization reduces redundancy in spatial feature extraction; and Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) boosts robustness by prioritizing key channels. We further propose LiteSyncNet-ST, a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture that combines the local feature extraction strengths of CNNs with the global context modeling capabilities of Swin Transformers. Crossdataset experiments covering four evaluation scenarios indicate that LiteSyncNet achieves an average 30.27% mean absolute error (MAE) reduction compared to the baseline EfficientPhys, while maintaining lightweight properties (2.17 M parameters). LiteSyncNet-ST achieves further gains, with an average 40.05% MAE reduction compared to EfficientPhys. Traditional time-domain losses (e.g., Time-Domain Mean Squared Error (TD-MSE)) fail to leverage the frequency-domain phase information of rPPG signals. Although some approaches incorporate frequency-domain information through hybrid loss functions, the reliance on time-domain components complicates training and optimization. Thus, we propose frequency-domain complex loss functions (FD-CMAE and FD-CMSE) independent of time-domain components. Experimental results demonstrate that these losses can independently serve as effective model losses, outperforming TD-MSE by an average of 14.59% in MAE across all evaluated models and datasets.

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data are widely used for computer-aided diagnosis of MDD. While multi-site fMRI data can provide more data for training reliable diagnostic models, significant cross-site data heterogeneity would result in poor model generalizability. Many domain adaptation methods are designed to reduce the distributional differences between sites to some extent, but usually ignore the overfitting problem of the model on the source domain. Intuitively, target data augmentation can alleviate the overfitting problem by forcing the model to learn more generalized features and reducing the dependence on source domain data. In this work, we propose a new augmentation-based unsupervised cross-domain fMRI adaptation (AUFA) framework for automatic diagnosis of MDD. The AUFA consists of (1) a graph representation learning module for extracting rs-fMRI features with spatial attention, (2) a domain adaptation module for feature alignment between source and target data, (3) an augmentation-based self-optimization module for alleviating model overfitting on the source domain, and (4) a classification module. Experimental results on 1,089 subjects suggest that AUFA outperforms several state-of-the-art methods. Our approach not only reduces data heterogeneity between sites but also localizes disease-related functional connectivity abnormalities and provides interpretability for the model.","Engineering, Biomedical",Augmentation-based unsupervised cross-domain functional MRI adaptation for major depressive disorder identification,,[]

However, the process is often subjective, with variability between experts. As a result, numerous deep learning-based automatic classification methods have emerged, most of which focus on respiratory sound classification. In contrast, research on respiratory sound event detection remains limited. Existing sound event detection methods typically rely on frame-level predictions followed by post-processing to generate event-level outputs, making interval boundaries challenging to learn directly. Furthermore, many approaches can only handle fixed-length audio, limiting their applicability to variable-length respiratory sounds. Additionally, the impact of respiratory sound location information on detection performance has not been extensively explored. To address these issues, we propose a graph neural network-based framework with anchor intervals, capable of handling variable-length audio and providing more precise temporal localization for abnormal respiratory sound events.

Employing an effective early screening technique can significantly enhance therapeutic outcomes for children with biliary atresia, especially in remote rural areas. To achieve this goal, leveraging deep learning in medical imaging holds the potential to reduce diagnostic errors, alleviate the workload on radiologists, and expedite the diagnosis process. However, training such deep learning models necessitates extensive and precise annotated datasets, which might be scarce, highly imbalanced, and limited in size due to restricted access and the rarity of the biliary atresia disease. This paper introduces a novel approach, SSL-OHE (Self-Supervised Representation Learning combined with Optimized Heterogeneous Ensemble), for biliary atresia diagnosis. Specifically, an online clustering-based self-supervised method is employed to learn unsupervised image representations, utilizing lightweight base learners initialized from a large general vision dataset. The pre-trained base learners serve as a representation model used in a specific classification task by fine-tuning all parameters in supervised training for the downstream task of diagnosing biliary atresia (BA). Subsequently, a numerical optimization method is employed to determine weights for the various base learners. These models are combined using a heterogeneous ensemble approach to ensure accurate BA detection and mitigate the impact of highly unbalanced data.

Although previous electroencephalography (EEG) research has examined spectral biomarkers of cognitive load, most studies employed static task paradigms that average neural activity across entire difficulty levels. Such an approach presupposes that cognitive load remains constant within each level, thereby neglecting transient fluctuations that may arise during information processing. To address this limitation, we implemented a novel EEG-based incremental encoding paradigm to track dynamic changes in cognitive load over time. EEG was recorded from 24 healthy young adults performing the Corsi Block-Tapping Test, a visuospatial shortterm memory task with sequential stimulus presentation. Items were added one by one to working memory, simulating real-world cognitive demands. Spectral absolute power was estimated across theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), low beta (13-20 Hz), high beta (20-30 Hz), and gamma (> 30 Hz) bands in frontal and parietal regions. Independently of the number of encoded elements, spectral power increased relative to rest: frontal theta by 80.52%, parietal theta by 139.66%, and frontal alpha by 17.72%, reflecting general attention engagement. In contrast, low beta power decreased consistently as more items were encoded (rho < 0.01, r > 0.5), arising as the most reliable biomarker of incremental memory load. A spectral shift toward higher beta frequencies was also observed with increased load. These results challenge the conventional understanding of theta as a biomarker of working memory and highlight beta-band dynamics as key to real-time cognitive monitoring in adaptive systems.","Engineering, Biomedical",EEG biomarkers of cognitive load: Insights from incremental element encoding in short-term working memory,,[]
,0,2026-02-01,BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL,"Objective: Echo planar imaging (EPI) is a standard fast imaging technique commonly used in functional MRI (fMRI). However, EPI is prone to artifacts that reduce the temporal stability of BOLD signals and impair detection of activation in task-based fMRI and functional connectivity in resting-state fMRI, especially when combined with simultaneous multislice (SMS) and in-plane acceleration. Thus, robust parallel imaging with effective artifact elimination is crucial for fMRI using SMS EPI. Methods: This study proposes improving SMS EPI reconstruction by using split slice-GRAPPA (SP-SG) with slice-specific Nyquist ghost correction. Enhancements over conventional approaches are achieved by incorporating slice-specific phase error correction into SP-SG. Additionally, multi-shot EPI calibration is enhanced with phase-constraint SAKE (PC-SAKE), which fully eliminates phase errors between positive and negative echoes and inter-shot phase variation. The proposed PEC-SP-SG with PC-SAKE enhanced multi-shot EPI calibration was comprehensively compared with two alternative approaches: 1D linear phase-error corrected (LPC) SP-SG with multi-shot EPI calibration and PEC-SP-SG with FLASH calibration. Results: Both task-based and resting-state fMRI studies validate the effectiveness of PEC-SP-SG with PC-SAKE enhanced multi-shot EPI calibration. It outperforms alternatives by reducing artifacts and improving temporal stability, leading to increased t-scores in detecting brain activation and higher correlation coefficients in detecting functional connectivity. Conclusion: The proposed PEC-SP-SG with PC-SAKE enhanced multi-shot EPI calibration provides a robust implementation for SMS EPI reconstruction in fMRI studies, facilitating more reliable detection of brain activity and functional connectivity.","Engineering, Biomedical",Improved simultaneous multislice EPI reconstruction for functional MRI with slice-specific 2D Nyquist ghost correction,,[]

However, as the vessel depth increases, images become severely blurred due to strong light scattering in body tissue. Although deep learning has shown great promise in clear vessel segmentation, many models face challenges achieving accurate segmentation on blurred NIR blood vessels, due to limited training data and the non-learnability of bilinear upsampling. To address these challenges, in this study, a new decoder model named the DeMerge Transformer (DMTrans) is introduced. This model uses a new learnable upsampling approach that can adaptively enlarge useful information from the encoder pretrained in related fields, maintaining accurate results with limited data during fine-tuning. The DMTrans model includes both a DeMerging (DM) operation and a channel transformer mechanism. The DM operation also leverages channel information, which becomes more sufficient as the model layers deepen, to initialize spatial features. The transformer reconstructs the DM features to fuse global information and long-range dependencies, facilitating a dense, learnable upsampling process. The proposed method was evaluated on five blood vessel datasets (DRIVE, STARE, CHUAC, CHASE_DB1, and HRF) and an NIR transillumination image dataset (HV_NIR). The proposed method achieved an average 1.89% improvement in the Dice score across these benchmarks. The results demonstrate that the DMTrans model not only offers stronger capabilities for transferring prior knowledge but also proves to be an effective approach for datasets that are small in scale but require high precision.","Engineering, Biomedical",A learnable transformer decoder for blurred near-infrared blood vessel segmentation using domain adaptation with limited data,,[]

Existing deep learning models are limited by single-modality reliance, poor boundary segmentation, and insufficient feature modeling. To address these shortcomings, this work proposes a hybrid deep learning framework that integrates multi-scale attention mechanisms, graph-based relational learning, and evolutionary optimization techniques. The proposed pipeline enhances preprocessing using Sparse Edge-Preserving Enhancement (SEPE) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to maintain anatomical integrity while reducing noise. A Dual-Stream Hybrid Attention-Enhanced DeepLabv3+ (DS-HA-Deeplabv3+) network was employed for precise segmentation, incorporating both spatial and spectral attention to refine glandular boundary delineation. Discriminative feature selection was achieved through the Adaptive Binary Horse Herd Optimization Algorithm (ABHHOA) and classification was performed a Hypergraph Neural Network with Multi-Scale Relational Encoding (HGNN-MRE) to capture higher-order dependencies among radiomic features.

Consequently, the development of a robust and efficient automatic segmentation method is crucial for the clinical management of brain tumors. Deep learning has achieved remarkable progress in the field of medical image segmentation, demonstrating substantial potential for improving accuracy and consistency in tumor delineation. However, existing mainstream segmentation methods generally involve a large number of parameters, while segmentation models with fewer parameters often exhibit a decline in segmentation accuracy. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel convolutional neural network architecture-the lightweight shared multi-attention network (LSMAtt-Net). This architecture integrates the lightweight shared dilation convolution (LSDC) module and the lightweight multi-attention mechanism (LMA), which simultaneously accounts for both segmentation accuracy and model complexity. The LSDC module employs dilated convolutions with shared weights of varying sizes to capture multi-scale information while effectively reducing the number of parameters. The LMA mechanism efficiently selects and weights important feature channels from a limited set of feature maps, thereby enhancing the extraction of detailed features. In the experimental results on the BraTS2023 Glioma dataset, LSMAtt-Net achieved Dice scores of 91.35% and 87.16% for whole tumor and tumor core, respectively, with a parameter count of only 0.516 million.

However, current methods face notable limitations, primarily due to their inability to comprehensively capture the intrinsic relationships between key local facial regions and global features. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel framework named the Attention-driven Contextual Feature Fusion Network (ACF-Net). This framework is designed to efficiently extract and integrate both local and global features from facial videos. Specifically, we design an Attention-Based Feature Association Module (AFAM) and incorporate it into the ResNet architecture. This module initially extracts local facial features using a multi-scale spatial attention mechanism and subsequently captures global features through a global context attention mechanism. Ultimately, the framework establishes a robust association between local and global feature maps by integrating them. Additionally, we enhance the integration of global and local features by jointly optimizing high-level global representations, which serve as input to the attention mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that ACF-Net achieves mean absolute errors (MAE) of 6.87 and 6.51 and root mean square errors (RMSE) of 9.05 and 8.68 on the AVEC 2013 and AVEC 2014 datasets, respectively.

To address these limitations, we propose a novel deep learning architecture, Bi-CSAM-Net, that integrates advanced data preprocessing techniques, attention mechanism, and the CNN model as a benchmark for segmentation tasks. The preprocessing techniques use dynamic contrast enhancement, multi-resolution data integration, and patient-specific normalization (DCA-TR) to focus on the finer voxel-specific features to enhance model performance.

Recent deep learning models, including Knowledge Distillation (KD) methods, have shown promising results in brain tumor image identification but still face limitations in handling uncertainty and generalizing across diverse medical conditions. Traditional KD methods often rely on a context-unaware temperature parameter to soften teacher model predictions, which does not adapt effectively to varying uncertainty levels present in medical images. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework that integrates Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for optimal teacher-student model selection and a novel context-aware predictor approach for temperature scaling. The proposed context-aware framework adjusts the temperature based on factors such as image quality, disease complexity, and teacher model confidence, allowing for more robust knowledge transfer.

On the other hand, transformer-based methods can establish such dependencies through self-attention, but they suffer from quadratic computational complexity, making it challenging to process 3D inputs. Additionally, the pooling operation in their encoding stage often results in feature loss, and their ability to extract multi-scale contextual information is limited. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SCEA-Net, a novel approach tailored for precise 3D medical image segmentation. The core of SCEA-Net is the spatial-channel-aware external attention model (SCEAM), which integrates parallel external attention mechanisms with convolutions to effectively capture crucial spatial and channel information. This attention mechanism leverages memory-based storage units to consider potential relationships among all samples in the dataset, while also reducing model complexity through linear computation methods. Furthermore, we have designed parallel pooling and convolutional down-sampling to minimize the loss of detailed features during the down-sampling process. Experimental results on the ACDC, Synapse, Tumor and cardiac left atrium segmentation datasets demonstrate that SCEA-Net outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of our approach.","Engineering, Biomedical",SCEA-Net: A hybrid framework from spatial-channel-aware external attention for accurate 3D medical image segmentation,,[]
,0,2026-03-01,BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL,"This study addresses two major bottlenecks in the clinical translation of polyp segmentation algorithms: high computational complexity and limited generalization capability. Through systematic analysis, we identify the root causes: (1) Most existing methods rely on complex decoder architectures and multi-level deep supervision strategies, leading to significant computational overhead during both training and inference stages; (2) These methods often utilize initial features extracted by the encoder without fully considering the diversity and complexity of polyp characteristics, thereby limiting model generalizability. To tackle these challenges, we propose DBFRNet, a Dual-Branch Feature Refinement Network for polyp segmentation, built upon the PVTv2 encoder. The primary innovations include the introduction of a Dual-Branch Feature Refinement (DBFR) module, which refines initial polyp features into two separate branches to enhance salient features while suppressing noise, thereby improving robustness and generalization. Furthermore, we design a lightweight Multi-Scale Attention Aggregation (MSAA) module to efficiently fuse features from different branches with minimal parameter overhead. Additionally, we propose a novel Dual-Branch Dynamic Sampling upsampling (DBDS) module to mitigate feature loss during decoding. DBFRNet features a compact and efficient architecture with only 24.78M parameters and 9.98 GFLOPs, achieving the lowest computational cost among current stateof-the-art (SOTA) methods. Despite its efficiency, DBFRNet delivers superior segmentation performance and achieves SOTA results on three unseen polyp segmentation benchmark datasets.","Engineering, Biomedical",DBFRNet: A dual-branch feature refinement network based on Pyramid Vision Transformer for polyp segmentation,,[]

This study introduces PBSNet, a lightweight deep learning model designed to achieve high classification precision from individual 2D slices while maintaining computational efficiency. Methods: We propose PBSNet (Parallel Branch Spatial Network), a convolutional neural network featuring a novel Parallel Branch Integration Module (PBIM) for enhanced intra-slice spatial feature extraction. PBSNet employs parallel 2D convolutional branches within the PBIM to simultaneously capture various spatial features of each slice. These features are subsequently integrated using a 3D convolution operating across the parallel branch dimension, designed to efficiently model complex patterns within individual slices and reduce computational complexity compared to standard 3D CNNs. Results: Evaluated on a dataset of 7023 individual MRI slices, PBSNet achieved a test accuracy of 98.63% and macro precision, recall, and F1 scores ranging from 97% to 100%. The model demonstrated a low test loss of 0.069 and a rapid training time of 367.2 s. With approximately 2.72 million parameters, PBSNet is compact and highly effective for slice-based classification. Conclusion: PBSNet integrates multi-pathway spatial analysis into an efficient architecture with a relatively low parameter count. By effectively processing individual MRI slices using parallel branches for feature extraction and integration, it offers a promising approach for applications where computational resources are limited, although inference speed requires further validation. This method provides a robust foundation for computer-aided diagnosis in neurooncology, enabling precise and resource-efficient brain tumor classification from 2D MRI data. Unlike conventional multi-branch CNNs that replicate parallel paths without specialized integration, PBSNet introduces a cross-branch 3D convolutional fusion module designed specifically for slice-level MRI analysis, enabling efficient intra-slice spatial diversity capture with minimal parameter overhead.","Engineering, Biomedical",PBSNet: Parallel branch spatial network for precise brain tumor classification in MRI slices,,[]
,0,2026-03-01,BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL,"Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings are frequently contaminated by physiological noises, including ocular and muscular artifacts, hindering advancement in neurophysiological research. Recent research suggested that EEG denoising models can be improved by integrating global and local features, adapting to the non-stationary nature of EEG signals. Building on this, we propose the receptive field hypothesis: increasing the receptive fields of neurons with respect to the input signal in a deep learning model should improve its noise reduction performance. Accordingly, we introduce the Multi-Scale Temporal Propagation Network (MSTP-Net), a deep learning-based EEG noise reducer, which use multi-scale temporal blocks (MSTBs) to propagate information across various temporal scales. Each MSTB divides the input signal into equal time segments, enabling local propagation within and global propagation across segments to alternately capture local and global features. In other words, the receptive field of each MSTB is explicitly enlarged. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that MSTP-Net outperforms existing methods, improving correlation coefficient from 0.8816 to 0.9221 and signal-to-noise ratio from 10.46 dB to 12.76 dB, while reducing relative root mean squared error in both temporal and spectral domains by 21.7% and 25.3%, respectively. Additional brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) experiments demonstrate that denoised EEG signals improve the accuracy of downstream analyses. Furthermore, the efficacy of MSTB is empirically validated through an ablation study, where we estimate the receptive fields of neurons in each MSTB, confirming that the performance in noise reduction is positively related to the average range of receptive fields.","Engineering, Biomedical",EEG noise reduction based on the Multi-Scale Temporal Propagation Network,,[]

However, conventional methods are often limited in their ability to capture complex spatiotemporal features, usually resulting in suboptimal accuracies. This study introduces a composite neural network, PLV-GCN+LSTM, designed for multi-domain information fusion to enhance the performance of MI EEG signal classification. The model utilizes the phase locking value (PLV) to establish functional connectivity graphs between EEG electrodes. Graph Convolution Networks (GCN) subsequently extract spatial features from these graph representations, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks process the GCN output to capture temporal dynamics. Validated on a self-collected dataset from Inner Mongolia University of Technology (IMUT) and the BCI Competition IV 2a public dataset, the proposed PLV-GCN+LSTM model demonstrated superior classification performance compared to several traditional machine learning algorithms and contemporary deep learning approaches. Compared to traditional algorithms such as CSP+SVM, DWT+SVM, WP+SVM, and AR+SVM, it achieved average accuracy improvements ranging from 10.45 to 12.60 percentage points on the IMUT dataset and 11.96 to 15.29 percentage points on the BCI Competition IV 2a dataset.

Although the primary goal is to prevent adverse intracranial hypertensive events, mechanical properties of the cerebrospinal system can also be derived from a closer analysis of the ICP signal. The morphology of the ICP signal can be influenced by a variety of physiological components and is therefore highly variable. In particular, on the time scale of a heartbeat, characteristic subpeaks called P1, P2, and P3 are visible most of the time and their analysis may provide valuable insights about cerebrospinal pressure-volume compensation. However, their automatic detection in real time is a challenging task that requires displaying no result in situations of uncertainty to avoid misleading the clinicians. Therefore, we applied several results from the ""Learn-then-Test'' theoretical framework to our deep learning-based delineation algorithm to identify cases where it is appropriate to refrain from providing a result. The subpeak detection task was performed using recurrent neural networks trained on a 59-patient dataset. Performance was evaluated on two independent test datasets. The first one consisted of 13,086 pulses extracted from 49 recordings and labeled by 3 independent operators. The second one, which is publicly available, consisted of 11,172 pulses extracted from 63 recordings.

How to effectively correct scatter signals in CT has always been a focal point of research for researchers. This work presents a new framework for eliminating scatter artifacts in CT. Methods: In the framework, the interaction between photons and matter is characterized as a Markov process, and the calculation of the scatter signal intensity in CT is transformed into the computation of a 4n-dimensional integral, where n is the highest scatter order. Given the low-frequency characteristics of scatter signals in CT, this paper uses the quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) method combined with forced fixed detection and down sampling to compute the integral. In the reconstruction process, the mutual influence between the scatter signal and the energy spectrum has been considered. A scatter-corrected spectrum estimation method is proposed and applied to estimate the X-ray energy spectrum. Based on the Feldkamp-Davis-Kress (FDK) algorithm, a multi-module coupled reconstruction method, referred to as FDK-QMC-BM4D, has been developed to simultaneously eliminate scatter artifacts, beam hardening artifacts, and noise in CT imaging. Results: The effectiveness of the FDK-QMC-BM4D method is validated in the Shepp-Logan phantom and head. Compared to the widely recognized Monte Carlo method, which is the most accurate method by now for estimating and correcting scatter signals in CT, the FDK-QMC-BM4D method improves the running speed by approximately 102 times while ensuring accuracy. Conclusion: By integrating the mechanism of FDK-QMC-BM4D, this study offers a novel approach to addressing artifacts in clinical CT.","Engineering, Biomedical",Scatter correction based on quasi-Monte Carlo for CT reconstruction,,[]

Early detection and intervention of FoG are crucial for improving the quality of life for PD patients. This study proposes a FoG detection method based on a multimodal graph convolutional network. Specifically, human skeletal sequences are first extracted from the monitoring videos, and then wearable inertial sensor data are added into the human skeletal graph as extra nodes to form unified gait graph structure. To extract gait features from the above graph data, this study proposes combining dynamically learnable graph structure with the static human physical skeleton structure to form a dynamic and static combined adjacency matrix. Then, feature aggregation is performed in different channels based of the aforementioned graph structure. After the joint spatial features are obtained, multi-scale temporal convolution is applied to extract multi-scale temporal features at different time scales.

,0,2026-02-01,BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL,"Continuous estimation of finger joint angles (CEFJA) by decoding surface electromyography (sEMG) from the upper-limb has garnered significant attention due to its ability to provide synchronized and proportional control of robotic hands. However, two challenges still exist: (1) CEFJA using only sEMG cannot achieve satisfactory accuracy, and (2) the accuracy of CEFJA drops sharply in the cross-subjects scenarios as sEMG varies significantly among different subjects, which implies that despite utilizing more subjects for training, the accuracy of each subject is still low. As three-axis accelerometers (ACC) can provide information directly related to upper limb movement, here we first propose a novel CNN-Transformer hybrid network called Fusionformer for ACC-sEMGbased CEFJA to address the challenge (1), and then propose a multi-modal transfer learning strategy called Modality-Wise Adversarial Discriminative Domain Adaptation (MW-ADDA) to address challenge (2). The Fusionformer consists of a representation learning module with separate ACC and sEMG branches, each integrating dual-stream CNN-Transformer networks to capture both short-term and long-term dependencies, and a modal fusion module employing Multi-Modal Cross-Attention (MMCA) to combine modality-specific dependencies. The MW-ADDA strategy applies separate domain discriminators for each modality to enable effective cross-subjects knowledge transfer. We conducted four groups of experiments on the widely-used datasets Ninapro DB2 and DB7. Results show that the proposed Fusionformer outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and that the utilization of MW-ADDA can significantly improve the accuracy of Fusionformer on the target subject.

Contrastive learning techniques have been used to improve model performance on general imbalanced datasets compared to a typical supervised loss functions (for e.g., L1 loss). Literature for contrastive techniques involving sequential data within rehabilitation exercise assessment is lacking. Objective: Compare supervised sequential models trained with typical supervised loss function and contrastive loss functions, aiming to improve regression models performance on imbalanced rehabilitation exercises. Methods: The KInematic Assessment of MOvement and Clinical Scores for Remote Monitoring of Physical REhabilitation (KIMORE) is the largest dataset for rehabilitation exercise quality assessment, and was used to compare models. Contrastive and supervised sequential models were trained under identical parameters and compared using 5-fold cross validation. Results: For four out of five exercises present in the KIMORE dataset, models trained using supervised sequential contrastive loss functions performed better than L1 loss. These models also showed significant gains in areas of the dataset without many samples. These improvements come at the primary cost of increased training time and complexity. Conclusion: Model improvements from training with contrastive techniques outweigh the increased training time.

The aim of this work is to estimate and assess whether Newtonian viscosity is sufficient to quantify these parameters, given the non-Newtonian nature of blood. Additionally, we demonstrate that shear-thinning effects remain observable in large vessels despite artifacts commonly present in 4D Flow MR images.. To address this, we quantified the impact of blood rheology and hematocrit (Hct) on Wall Shear Stress (WSS), the rate of viscous Energy Loss (EL), and the Oscillatory Shear Index (OSI) based on velocity data obtained from 4D Flow MR images. Using a Hct-dependent power-law non-Newtonian model with experimentally derived rheological parameters, we analyzed these metrics across a broad range of Hct values at physiological temperatures in both in-silico and in-vivo MR datasets. The results reveal significant differences between Newtonian and non-Newtonian models.

In this study, we employed scanning probe microscopy (SPM)-based stress relaxation tests to characterize viscoelastic properties across the denticle and smooth skin bands in three larval instars. Four viscoelastic models were evaluated, and the five-element Maxwell (MX5) model provided the best fit, enabling the extraction of mechanical parameters and plotting of relaxation modulus functions. Results showed that the larval instar stage had minimal influence on viscoelasticity, while the denticle and smooth skin bands exhibited distinct mechanical behaviors. Across all instars, the denticle bands showed higher moduli throughout the relaxation process, and notably, exhibited a greater degree and faster rate of relaxation compared to the smooth skin bands.

While this setup effectively induces asymmetrical adaptations beneficial for unilateral deficits like post-stroke hemiparesis, its design is less ideal for symmetrical impairments such as bilateral plantarflexor (PF) weakness common in aging. We introduce a novel split-belt treadmill paradigm with two distinct conditions that vary each belt's speed based on its corresponding limb's phase of gait. In the 'TrailFast' condition, each belt accelerated across the stance phase and decelerated during swing. In the 'LeadFast' condition, each belt accelerated during swing and decelerated across the stance phase. The natural phase offset between limbs transformed these inputs into consistent inter-limb speed differences during double support. These speed differences were intended to alter the pre-swing position of the feet to evoke adaptations in PF force production bilaterally. Twenty healthy adults completed a continuous 6-minute adaptation period in each condition. Upon returning to constant-speed walking, the conditions produced opposing, bilateral after-effects in PF impulse (p < 0.001). Specifically, TrailFast significantly increased PF impulse by 0.054 N center dot m center dot s/BW (p < 0.001), while LeadFast significantly decreased it by 0.061 N center dot m center dot s/BW (p < 0.001).

In this study, we used a 3D finite element model to investigate methodological approaches to measure soleus stiffness during passive and active lengthening. Performing a single passive lengthening simulation, we calculated a range of Young's modulus values for the soleus muscle based on different definitions of stress and strain that all overestimated stiffness of the prescribed muscle material. Stiffness measurements made from fully active lengthening simulations were dependent on the timing of activation relative to muscle length change, with greater stiffness estimated when activation increased concurrently with muscle length compared to when the muscle was fully activated before lengthening. Simulations with independently varied activation of the posterior and anterior compartments demonstrated how these different regions of muscle fascicles have minimal effects on each's kinematics while influencing soleus force production. While the anterior compartment is difficult to measure experimentally, model predictions suggest it interacts with the posterior compartment to modulate soleus stiffness.

This spatially integrated approach captures deviations from steady motion trajectories and reflects dynamic coordination variability. We applied the method to gait data from 42 healthy adults (24 young, 18 older) walking at eight speeds (40-145 % of preferred speed, normalized as a Froude number). Using a spherical coordination transformation, we calculated CVrfor the pelvis, hip, knee, ankle, and foot. In young adults, CVrincreased with speed and was higher at distal joints, indicating adaptive flexibility. Older adults showed the same segmental hierarchy but with a reduced CVrat the ankle and knee, reflecting more constrained control. Significant joint x speed x age interactions confirmed that CVr captures both functional coordination and age-related adaptations. This new approach enables efficient, spatially integrated analysis of 3D movement coordination and variability.

However, no study has evaluated the triceps surae muscle and tibial nerve stiffnesses simultaneously or clarified their correlation with the maximum angle. This study aimed to investigate the correlation between the maximum angle and both the stiffnesses. Forty-one healthy adults participated. The maximum angle of ankle dorsiflexion and shear wave velocities of the triceps surae muscles and tibial nerve at 5 degrees, 15 degrees, and 25 degrees ankle dorsiflexion were measured. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed using forced entry method, specifying the shear wave velocities of the four tissues as the independent variables and the maximum angle as the dependent variable. This analysis was performed at each angle where the shear wave velocity was measured. Multiple linear regression analysis was also performed using stepwise method, specifying the shear wave velocities of the tibial nerve at the three angles as the independent variables and the maximum angle as the dependent variable. Using the forced entry method, the shear wave velocity of the tibial nerve at each angle was significantly negatively correlated with the maximum angle, whereas those of the muscles were not. Using the stepwise method, only the shear wave velocity of the tibial nerve at 25 degrees was significantly negatively correlated with the maximum angle. These results suggest that the tibial nerve stiffness at a higher length seems to be one determinant of the maximum angle.","Engineering, Biomedical",Tibial nerve stiffness is related to maximum angle of ankle dorsiflexion,,[]

While prior studies have explored this task, they often lack a comprehensive examination of kinematic and kinetic changes throughout the entire gait cycle across varying obstacle heights. This study creates a novel dataset collected from ten healthy adults performing obstacle crossing at four different heights (7.5 cm, 15 cm, 22.5 cm, and 30 cm). Kinematic and kinetic data (angles and torques of hip, knee, and ankle) were recorded and analyzed. Results indicate that increased obstacle height leads to a longer swing phase and significant increases in both hip and knee joint angles (1.5 x and 1.0x, respectively) and torques. In contrast, ankle joint angles and moments exhibited minimal variation across obstacle heights, indicating a relatively consistent movement strategy at the ankle. Furthermore, significant asymmetries were observed between the dominant and non-dominant foot: the dominant foot demonstrated larger hip and knee joint angles and more consistent ankle behavior, reflecting greater coordination. These findings offer valuable biomechanical insights for improving fall prevention strategies and informing the design of assistive devices such as prostheses and exoskeletons.","Engineering, Biomedical",A kinematic and kinetic dataset of lower limb joints during obstacle crossing in healthy young adults,,[]

Traditional function assessments, primarily relying on blood flow rate, often fail to capture the geometric and hemodynamic influences on graft patency. To address these limitations, this retrospective study aimed to establish a comprehensive risk prediction model that incorporates both flow dynamics and geometric features, facilitating clinically applicable evaluations. A total of 110 patient-specific CABG geometries were reconstructed from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) images to extract key geometric parameters for subsequent statistical analysis. An additional 28 cases were analyzed for statistical and hemodynamic validation. Three logistic regression models were built and validated for restenosis risk prediction. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed to investigate the hemodynamic characteristics of high-risk grafts. A MATLAB-based software tool was also developed to automate the analysis workflow. Among the three prediction models, the one combining graft flow and geometric factors balanced sensitivity and specificity, and performed best in the validation cohort (area under curve = 0.758, sensitivity = 89.1 %). CFD simulations on the validation cohort confirmed that grafts with high predicted risk exhibited poor hemodynamic conditions, including low time-averaged wall shear stress, high oscillatory shear index, and high relative residence time. Further statistical analysis revealed complex context-dependent interactions between graft flow and geometry. This study presents an integrated approach to restenosis risk prediction by combining patient-specific flow and geometric features. These findings are expected to enhance clinical decision-making and support more individualized postoperative management strategies in CABG.","Engineering, Biomedical",Graft restenosis risk prediction after coronary artery bypass surgery based on both flow and geometric configuration,,[]

Addressing this limitation requires the identification of reliable invasion biomarkers and the development of highly specific materials to enable complete resection of diffuse glioma. This review explores the infiltrative growth patterns of glioma and classifies margin-associated biomarkers into three major categorizes: molecular, cellular and structural abnormities. Particular emphasis is placed on molecular and functional biomarkers, which often manifest earlier and more faithfully reflect cancer cell distribution than structural markers. We also highlight recent advancements in engineering materials and probes capable of detecting these abnormalities beyond the reach of conventional diagnostic tools, thereby enhancing intraoperative precision. Finally, we outline future perspectives for refining biomarker discovery and probe design to facilitate maximal safe resection. By advancing next-generation technologies for delineating diffuse glioma margins, these efforts hold promise for improving surgical outcomes and patient survival.","Engineering, Biomedical",Tailoring imaging probes for defining glioma invasive margins: Tracing the molecular footprints of cancer cells,,[]

Peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (Pin1) is overexpressed in several cancer cells and plays a critical role in tumorigenesis and tumor progression. All-trans retinoic acid (RA) is known to induce cell death by generating ROS and directly binding the active site of Pin1, leading to cancer cell death. In this work, we developed boronated RA-based heterodimeric prodrug (BRDP) to fully enhance RA's functions as both a redox homeostasis disruptor and a Pin1 inhibitor for dual targeted cancer therapy. BRDP self-assembled into colloidal nanoparticles in the presence of sulfated polysaccharide fucoidan, which binds P-selectin overexpressed on cancer cells. Fucoidan-modified boronated BRDP (f-BRDP) nanoparticles amplified oxidative stress by simultaneously generating ROS and depleting glutathione (GSH), leading to enhanced cancer cell death. Additionally, f-BRDP degraded Pin1, activating tumor suppressors and inactivating oncogenes. In vivo xenograft studies confirmed that f-BRDP nanoparticles preferentially accumulated at tumor sites and significantly inhibited tumor growth with minimal systemic toxicity. These findings highlight f-BRDP nanoparticles as a promising tumor-targeted therapeutic platform that overcomes the limitations of conventional therapeutics and advances precision nanomedicine.

Current non-surgical treatments, such as minoxidil and finasteride, provide limited and temporary benefits. Here, we report the development of a novel, cell-free regenerative therapy using the secretome of human fetal cartilage progenitor cells (ShFCPC), enriched with extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and bioactive factors critical for tissue remodeling and cell survival. Proteomic analysis of ShFCPC identified key biomolecules involved in cell survival, adhesion, and tissue remodeling. In vitro, ShFCPC significantly enhanced DP cell viability, proliferation, and migration, particularly under testosterone-induced apoptosis, restoring (3-catenin signaling and integrin-mediated ECM interactions. In a co-culture model, ShFCPC promoted the formation of hair follicle germs (HFGs) and improved the expression of trichogenic markers and cell organization. In vivo, ShFCPCtreated HFGs successfully regenerated functional hair follicles in nude mice and reversed testosterone-induced hair loss in rats. ShFCPC treatment led to a significant increase in hair regrowth (94.9 % coverage vs. 44.7 % in controls) and improved follicle structure, including sebaceous glands, dermal papillae, and hair shafts. Moreover, the expression of key hair follicle markers, such as (3-catenin and CD34, which are critical for hair follicle regeneration, was significantly upregulated. Importantly, no toxicity was observed in ShFCPC-treated animals, confirming its safety profile. These findings demonstrate that ShFCPC enhances the hair-inductive potential of DP cells by modulating apoptosis and activating (3-catenin signaling.

The Ce3+/Ce4+ ratio can be manipulated via regulating the ZIF-8 shell thickness. The shell thickness increased with elevated concentration of Zn2+ that coordinated with organic linker in the synthesis process, leading to enhanced Ce3+/Ce4+ ratio in CeO2@ZIF-8, which further promoted its antioxidative enzyme mimetic activities as well as osteogenic property.

Disruption of this sequential regulation often leads to impaired epithelial regeneration and fibrotic remodeling. Transforming growth factor-(31 (TGF-(31) plays a pivotal role in fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis, yet exogenous delivery is limited by instability, off-target effects and fibrotic scarring risk. To address these challenges, we developed a sequential immune-regenerative strategy, in which early anti-inflammatory modulation is followed by localized enrichment of endogenous regenerative cues. (3-peptides with high binding affinity to TGF-(31 were trivalently presented on a tetrahedral framework nucleic acid (tFNA) to enable efficient cytokine capture (over 90 % efficiency), while curcumin was incorporated to provide early-phase immunoregulation by suppressing NF-KB signaling, thereby creating a permissive environment for subsequent remodeling. These dual functions were combined in a (33Tc nanostructure, which was subsequently incorporated into a hyaluronic acid methacryloyl (HAMA) scaffold to form a composite hydrogel (HA-(33Tc).

While glutathione (GSH) has been identified as a key molecule in enhancing the synergistic effects of these two processes, inherent cellular redox homeostasis mechanisms limit its therapeutic efficacy. This inspired us to explore other new regulators to potentiate the synergistic effect. Through bioinformatics analysis and preliminary experimental validation, we discovered that lactate metabolism is closely associated with both ferroptosis and cuproptosis. Therefore, this work strategically targets lactate metabolism to synergistically activate cuproptosis and ferroptosis, and elucidate its immunotherapeutic mechanisms. For this purpose, we constructed a Syr-loaded nanodelivery system (Syr@mPDA@CP) using biocompatible mesoporous polydopamine (mPDA) as the carrier. Upon targeting tumor tissues, the released Syr significantly inhibits lactate efflux, leading to intracellular lactate accumulation. This lactate buildup further induces intracellular acidification, exerting dual effects: (1) promoting ferritin (FTH1) dissociation to release endogenous iron stores, thereby elevating intracellular iron levels; and (2) suppressing glycolysis and reducing ATP levels, which inactivates the copper export protein ATP7B. Combined with copper peroxide (CP)-derived Cu2+, these effects synergistically amplify intracellular copper accumulation. The elevated intracellular Cu and Fe concentrations subsequently induce dual cell death pathways of cuproptosis and ferroptosis, effectively enhancing cancer immunotherapy.

Nanobubbles (NBs) are novel extravascular ultrasound contrast agents with the ability to perform ultrasound-triggered drug delivery. On the other hand, we found that cell membrane disruption therapy is suitable for working synergistically with SDT.

The effect in killing tumor cells has been confirmed, including the performance to destroy cells by their outer QAS shells, and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in SDT process. We found that treated tumor cells were induced to undergo immunogenic cell death (ICD).

Previous studies have shown a wide variation in iliac wing fracture tolerance with no significant relationships to pelvis size, sex, or other factors. A weighted average bone density (BD) calculation of the entire iliac wing produced the best predictive performance of fracture tolerance in parametric (Weibull) survival models. As a result, we endeavored to evaluate local bone microstructural properties at the site of loading and evaluate their relationship to fracture tolerance.

Samples were scanned using micro-computed tomography, then 20 different cortical and trabecular bone measurements for each sample were evaluated. A principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted to reduce the dimensionality and identify the features of iliac wing microstructure that account for the most variation in the measurements. The first principal component, which represented bone quantity, accounted for over 33 % of the variation in the specimen microstructures. This component improved the survival model fit to the data more than any other previous model.

,0,2026-03-01,BIOMATERIALS,"The stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway represents a promising target in cancer immunotherapy. However, the clinical translation of cyclic dinucleotide (CDN)-based STING agonists remains hindered by insufficient formation of functional CDN-STING complexes. This critical bottleneck arises from two interdependent barriers: inefficient cytosolic CDN delivery and tumor-specific STING silencing via DNA methyltransferase-mediated promoter hypermethylation. To overcome this, we engineered DecG@Al, a dualaction platform combining clinically approved aluminum hydroxide (Alum), the CDN agonist 2 ' 3 '-cGAMP, and the DNA demethylating agent decitabine. Alum enhances 2 ' 3 '-cGAMP transmembrane delivery while improving decitabine bioavailability for epigenetic STING restoration, synergistically amplifying intracellular CDN-STING complexes and STING pathway activation. In B16F10 melanoma models, DecG@Al reprogrammed the immunosuppressive microenvironment by skewing macrophages toward a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype, activating dendritic cells, and reducing CD8+ T cell exhaustion. Transcriptomic analysis revealed broad immune activation, including upregulated pro-inflammatory chemokines in tumor-associated macrophages. This immunomodulation translated to potent tumor suppression, prolonged survival, and minimal systemic toxicity. By coupling STING agonist delivery and receptor restoration, DecG@Al addresses the root cause of CDN-STING complex insufficiency, offering a clinically translatable strategy to reignite antitumor immunity.","Engineering, Biomedical",Resolve and regulate: Alum nanoplatform coordinating STING availability and agonist delivery for enhanced anti-tumor immunotherapy,,[]
,0,2026-03-01,BIOMATERIALS,"Background: Traditional cartilage grafts for nasal alar retraction repair often lack sufficient elasticity and histocompatibility, leading to suboptimal clinical outcomes. To address this challenge, we developed a biomimetic engineered cartilage scaffold that combines self-assembled human adipose-derived stem cell (hADSC)/human nasal septal chondrocyte (hNSC) spheroids with a 3D-printed M-shaped polyurethane (Pu)/gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hybrid scaffold, aiming to replicate the extracellular matrix (ECM) components and mechanical properties of native alar cartilage. Methods: The M-shaped scaffold was designed based on clinical CT reconstruction and fabricated via 3D printing using Pu for optimal elasticity. hADSCs and hNSCs were co-cultured at varying ratios (0:5-5:0) and loaded as spheroids into GelMA-coated scaffolds. ECM components (Col-1, Col-2, ACAN, Elastin) were analyzed via RTqPCR and immunohistochemistry. Subcutaneous (nude mice) and in-situ nasal (sheep) implantation models evaluated chondrogenic performance, ECM deposition and structural integration over 1-2 months. Results: Through comparative analysis of extracellular matrix (ECM) components among human alar cartilage, nasal septal cartilage, auricular cartilage, and costal cartilage, we identified the target ECM profile for biomimetic alar cartilage engineering. It was verified that self - assembled spheroids have stronger chondrogenic abilities. Among them, the ECM secretion of 80 % hADSCs/20 % hNSCs spheroids was closest to that of alar cartilage. In vitro and in vivo experiments on the M-shaped spheroids-laden Pu/GelMA hybrid scaffolds showed that the secretion levels of key ECM proteins were similar to those of natural alar cartilage. 3D surface imaging confirmed that the scaffold could provide precise alar - nasal tip contour subcutaneously, and no contracture was observed. MRI confirmed the stability of the scaffold in nude rats and sheep, as well as its seamless integration with host nasal tissues. Conclusion: By prioritizing ECM component regulation through cell ratio optimization and spheroid culture, this study establishes a histologically biomimetic scaffold that faithfully recapitulates the biochemical and structural complexity of alar cartilage. The approach offers a promising alternative to traditional grafts for nasal reconstruction.","Engineering, Biomedical",Self-assembled hADSCs/hNSCs spheroids combined with 3D printed M-shaped GelMA/Pu Scaffolds: Creating histologically biomimetic engineered cartilage that meets the characteristics of alar cartilage,,[]

Herein, we present a novel sprayable double-network hydrogel platform designed to achieve efficient antimicrobial activity and accelerated wound repair under hypoxic conditions by leveraging a type I photodynamic therapy (PDT) and immune-metabolic regulatory strategy. Specifically, we employ salvianolic acid B (SAB) to form a self-assembled hydrogel (SAB-gel) and incorporate fibrin to construct a robust and acidic double-network SAB/F-gel with enhanced mechanical strength and acidic environment. Concurrently, thymoquinone (TQ) and chlorin e6 (Ce6) are self-assembled via hydrophobic interactions to form TQ/Ce6 nanoparticles (TQ/Ce6 NPs) and embedded in the SAB/F-gel, to fabricate the TQ/Ce6@SAB/F-gel. Under low-oxygen conditions, TQ acts as an electron-transfer mediator, enabling Ce6 to generate abundant superoxide anions (center dot O2-) via type I PDT under red light (RL) irradiation. These center dot O2- are subsequently converted into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) in the acidic environment provided by acidic SAB/F-gel, thereby reducing the dependence on oxygen and maintaining potent antimicrobial efficacy against MRSA, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa), Acinetobacter baumannii (Ab), Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Candida albicans (Ca). In vitro experiments demonstrated that TQ/Ce6@SAB/F-gel regulates macrophage M2 polarization and promotes endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation via the immunemetabolic regulatory pathways. When applied to MRSA-infected diabetic wounds in mice, the hydrogel in combination with RL completely eradicated bacteria, promoted collagen deposition and angiogenesis, and significantly accelerated wound closure, as demonstrated by histological examination and transcriptome sequencing. This work offers a versatile, biocompatible, and oxygen-independent PDT-based hydrogel system for the treatment of refractory infected diabetic wounds, offering potential for clinical translation and improved patient outcomes.","Engineering, Biomedical",A sprayable TQ/Ce6@SAB/F-gel for accelerating wound healing via hypoxia-tolerant photodynamic therapy and immune-metabolic pathway,,[]

Triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) have attracted considerable interest for their smooth surfaces (without sharp edges connections), lightweight, enhanced surface area, and tunable mechanical performance. This study adopted I-graph wrapped package (IWP), Neovius, primitive, and face-centered cubic rhombic dodecahedron (F-RD) TPMS for scaffold designs (3-6 mm cell size, 70 % porosity) and fabricated from polylactic acid using stereolithography 3D printing technique. Furthermore, multi-morphology graded (MMG) lattice structure designs were proposed, combining two TPMS unit cell types, which showed high mechanical properties. Gradient transitions were introduced using sinusoidal patterns along a single axis (sin(x)), along two axes (sin(x + y)), and a linear diagonal transition (x +y) to form complex structures and enhance performance. The compression tests were performed to examine the deformation behavior, mechanical properties, and energy absorption characteristics. Among uniform structures, IWP and F-RD lattice exhibited the highest surface area to volume (SA/V) ratio of 7.44-10 mm2/mm3, whereas IWP and Neovius showed higher yield strength (9-15 MPa) and strain energy (5.96-16.44 MJ/m3). Moreover, deformation in IWP and primitive shifted from bulging to curve bending, while Neovius and F-RD changed from bulging to shear zone formation. Furthermore, MMG lattice structures (created from IWP/Neovius) exhibited modern SA/V (6-9 mm2/mm3) and improved yield strength (12-22 MPa).

However, the anti-cancer efficacy of PDIT is limited by insufficient ROS production and highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments (TMEs). In this study, a multi-bioactive nanocomposite consisting of hyaluronic acid-block-poly(1-methyl-(d)-tryptophan-co-(l)-glutamic acid) (HA-PMTG) and tetracarboxyl porphyrin-trivalent Fe(III) metal-organic framework (MOFTCPP-Fe) was developed for enhanced cascading PDIT. The spindle-shaped nanocomposite HA-PMTG@MOFTCPP-Fe, measuring 188 nm in length and 80 nm in width, demonstrated efficient uptake by 4T1 cells and alleviated tumor hypoxia through the Fenton reaction. Following intravenous injection, HA-PMTG@MOFTCPP-Fe selectively accumulated in mouse breast cancer 4T1 tumor for up to 48 h. Upon laser irradiation, photodynamic therapy (PDT) coupled with the inhibition of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) by 1-MDT successfully induced ICD, resulting in a 51.57% increase in cell surface calreticulin (CRT) positivity in the HA-PMTG@MOFTCPP-Fe group. This increase reduced immune tolerance, suppressed tumor growth, and extended the median survival of tumor-bearing mice to 120 days. Furthermore, treatment with HA-PMTG@MOFTCPP-Fe on the primary tumor inhibited distant tumor growth through a bystander effect and prevented tumor recurrence by activating immune memory.

Scaffolds were printed in both uniform and graded configurations at a fixed 60 % relative density and dimensions of 20 mm in diameter x 2 mm thickness. Compression test, energy absorption capacity and cell proliferation and attachment of the TPMS, were tested and analysed. The test results revealed that graded structures, particularly Split P and Neovius, demonstrated superior compressive strength, specific energy absorption, and elasticity compared to their uniform counterparts, indicating their suitability for load-bearing applications. Optical and Scanning Electron Microscopy analyses confirmed the consistency and accuracy of the 3D printed material distribution and structural performance. Biological evaluation using the A549 cell line demonstrated statistically significant differences in cell viability (p < 0.001) across scaffold types over 24, 48, and 72 h. Because A549 is a nonosteogenic screening model, these findings should be interpreted as preliminary cytocompatibility and attachment outcomes rather than osteogenic performance. This geometry-focused, material-agnostic study uses a dimensionally accurate SLA resin to isolate the effects of uniform vs. graded TPMS architectures on mechanics and early cell compatibility, establishing a controlled baseline to inform future work with bone-relevant cells and bioactive ceramics/metals. The Gyroid scaffold supported the highest early-stage proliferation, attributed to its continuous and highly interconnected pore geometry.

Based on the coordination chemistry of specific metal ions, the precise modulation of intracellular reduction mechanisms by blocking key enzyme activities is expected to become an emerging anti-tumor strategy. Here, we developed a copper-based nanoinducer (CST NPs) that simultaneously induces both cuproptosis and disulfidptosis by disrupting intracellular copper ion homeostasis. In the acidic tumor microenvironment (TME), CST NPs can inhibit glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity, thereby reducing NADPH production, decreasing cysteine conversion, and significantly depleting the substrate required for glutathione (GSH) synthesis. Subsequently, a substantial amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can be generated through the cascade catalysis of copper ions contained in CST NPs. Concurrently, the cellular redox homeostasis is further disrupted with the widespread depletion of GSH by Cu2+. In addition, CST NPs have been demonstrated to directly induce cytoskeletal contraction and rupture, resulting in membrane disruption and the subsequent exposure and release of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). This process initiates a potent immune response by reprogramming the immunosuppressive TME. This work presents a novel paradigm that precisely regulates intracellular copper ion homeostasis to induce both cuproptosis and disulfidptosis, offering a new theoretical basis for further elucidating the potential mechanisms of copper-induced cell death.","Engineering, Biomedical",Disrupting intracellular redox homeostasis through copper-driven dual cell death to induce anti-tumor immunotherapy,,[]

THMH integrates a nanoporous cartilage-mimetic layer and a macroporous osteogenic layer, interconnected via gradient pores to facilitate nutrient transport, vascularization, and cellular crosstalk. In vitro evaluations revealed that the THMH has excellent biocompatibility and the ability to promote multidirectional differentiation of BMSCs. RNA-seq results indicated that cartilage-like layer of THMH may promote the chondrogenic differentiation of BMSCs by its mechanical properties and KGN to activate integrin-PI3K-AKT signaling axis.

However, eliminating residual tumor cells, preventing bacterial infection, and ensuring effective osseointegration remain key challenges. In this paper, the implant containing a dual-release system was developed. First, a primary drug reservoir was constructed using nanotubes loaded with ZnO and rare earth elements (Y, Yb, Er). Second, a secondary phototherapy platform was created by coating the reservoir with a gelatin/sodium alginate hydrogel containing MgO2, curcumin, and paclitaxel. Flow acid etching and anodic oxidation removed residuals and formed TiO2 nanotube arrays, while rare earth doping enhanced upconversion capability. Under 808 nm near-infrared irradiation (NIR), localized photothermal heating (54 degrees C) triggered hydrogel degradation, releasing the contents. Subsequently, the primary reservoir facilitated sustained Zn2+ release alongside micro-nano cues. The modified surface demonstrated improved wettability and superior corrosion resistance. Meanwhile, the hydrogel exhibited near-complete degradation (95 %) within 21 days, corresponding to the optimal therapeutic window following tumor resection. The biological experiments demonstrated that the dual-release system systematically inhibited tumor growth, eradicated bacterial infections, and promoted osteogenesis. Furthermore, this system modulated intracellular signaling pathways in both bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and osteosarcoma cells (HOS).

Exosomes (Exos) have emerged as promising drug carriers; however, their clinical application is hindered by low yield, limited drug-loading capacity, and suboptimal delivery efficiency. To overcome these challenges, we developed a nanosecond pulsed microfluidic system (T-nsPMs) for the high-throughput production of engineered Exos. These Exos were co-modified with a 5HT1D antibody and CD47 protein (TCMExos) to construct a nanoscale drug delivery system for the targeted delivery of microRNA-29b (miR-29b). TCMExos effectively penetrated the ECM, evaded macrophage phagocytosis, and targeted aHSCs, enabling the precise release of miR-29b at the site of fibrosis. This led to the inhibition of hepatic stellate cells activation, as demonstrated by the significant downregulation of alpha-SMA, COL1A1, TIMP-1, and phosphorylated SMAD2 proteins.

The system is composed of a Red Blood Cell-Liposome hybrid membrane camouflaged Mn-Ce6 nanocomplex, which is further modified with a PtdSer aptamer (MC@RL/Apt). MC@RL/Apt demonstrates prolonged circulation time and enhanced tumor accumulation, capable of inducing cancer cell apoptosis and PtdSer externalization under 660 nm light irradiation. The externalized PtdSer is then recognized by the PtdSer aptamer, which recruits additional MC@RL/Apt to the tumor site, facilitating a self-amplified tumor accumulation effect. In vitro studies show that MC@RL/Apt acted as an efferocytosis inhibitor, suppressing macrophage phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and promoting macrophage polarization toward the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype. Compared to nonfunctionalized MC@RL, intravenous administration of MC@RL/Apt increases tumor accumulation by 1.46fold under 660 nm light irradiation. As a result, treatment with MC@RL/Apt effectively suppressed tumor growth and induced robust antitumor immune responses. This work highlights a self-amplifying tumor-targeting strategy that leverages externalized PtdSer on apoptotic cells as a target to enhance tumor-specific drug delivery, while simultaneously inhibiting PtdSer-mediated macrophage engulfment, offering a promising approach for improving cancer therapy outcomes.","Engineering, Biomedical",A phosphatidylserine-targeted self-amplifying nanosystem improves tumor accumulation and enables efficient tumor therapy by modulating anticancer immunity,,[]

Currently, effective treatments such as liver and hepatocyte transplantation are hindered by donor shortages. Consequently, hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) derived from human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADSCs) present substantial therapeutic potential as alternative cells. Establishing a supportive niche is conducive to regulating the differentiation of hADSCs into HLCs with the necessary metabolic and therapeutic functions. In this study, we develop a hydrogel-based synthetic niche composed of decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) and oxidized dextran (ODex). These hydrogels, with tunable viscoelasticity and stiffness, regulate hepatic differentiation through Yes-associated protein (YAP) mechanotransduction. Specifically, a combination of faster stress relaxation rate and lower stiffness approximating that of mouse liver fosters the hepatic differentiation of hADSCs. Additionally, this niche also promotes HLC paracrine functions in pro-angiogenesis, antioxidative stress, and anti-inflammation. In vivo experiments reveal that hydrogel-based biomechanical nichesregulated HLCs demonstrate satisfactory therapeutic effects in mice with CCl4-induced ALF.

Though biomaterials are used clinically to enhance wound closure rate and quality of healed tissue, their mechanisms of action are less understood. Here we use proteomic analysis to characterize changes in the wound healing response across three biomaterial treatments: a clinically used collagen hydrogel, and two synthetic biomaterials that are characterized by an increased regenerative response either through decreased fibrosis or through an activation of adaptive immunity. We identified close to 5000 proteins shared across the biomaterial treatment groups, sampled at timepoints representing the inflammation, proliferation, and resolution phases of wound healing. The collagen hydrogel maintains an enrichment of immune-related pathways throughout the healing process. The fibrosissuppressing material enriches gene ontology (GO) terms related to increased epidermis development pathways, collagen synthesis, and collagen fibril organization. In contrast, the adaptive immunity-activating biomaterial shows an early enrichment of GO terms related to broad immunity and inflammation. Later, this same material promotes keratinization, muscle and lipid oxidation GO pathways. Taken together, this work determines the key temporal pathways (immunity, keratinization, muscle system process, and ECM organization) mediated by three biomaterials, which result in varying healed tissue structure.","Engineering, Biomedical",Comparative proteomic analysis of skin wound healing responses to biomaterial treatments identifies key pathways which govern differential regenerative outcomes,,[]

Herein, we develop a multifunctional gel that integrates marine-tolerance, wet adhesion, non-invasive detachment, good antibacterial properties to resist bleeding and promote wound healing in marine environments. Our design strategy employs solvent-exchangeinduced self-assembly of hydrophobic segments to engineer hydrophobic microdomains, coupled with the synergistic effects of hydrogen/ionic/coordination bonds as multicrosslinked networks, resulting in a marinetolerant hydrogel with a ""hydrophobic microdomain-multicrosslinked"" network structure. An ""interfacial drainage-multivalent bonding"" dual-effect adhesion strategy is proposed: the interfacial drainage effect induced by silicone oil and hydrophobic microdomains enables tight tissue-gel anchoring, while the cooperative interactions of hydrogen/carbon-nitrogen/carbon-sulfur bonds synergistically achieve strong interfacial adhesion, achieving stable wet adhesion in marine environments. Furthermore, glutathione can cleave the disulfide bonds within the gel and the carbon-sulfur bonds between the gel and tissue, facilitating non-invasive detachment. Besides, the incorporation of zinc oxide nanoparticles provides broad-spectrum antibacterial functionality.

The propensity of AAA rupture is dependent on the macro as well as micro and nanoscale heterogeneity in its mechanical properties. Previous studies have shown that AAA tissue comprises of mechanically soft and stiff regions as compared to healthy tissue. However, the correlation of these heterogeneous mechanical properties to its structural components are not well characterized. In this study we used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to analyze human AAA tissue, extracted at the time of vascular surgery. In addition, healthy and diseased aortic tissue from a porcine model of AAA were examined. AFM was used to generate topographical images of tissue sections in a fluid environment, which were identified to be collagenous or non-collagenous regions. Quantitative Nanomechanical Mapping of the corresponding regions was performed to ascertain the local modulus. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and histological staining were used to localize calcific deposits. Our results indicate that AAA tissue is mechanically heterogenous with the modulus of collagenous regions being twice that of non-collagenous regions. The moduli of porcine AAA were comparable to that of human AAA and higher than healthy aorta from the corresponding animals. In addition, AAA tissue was interspersed with nanoscale particles of higher moduli, likely representing calcific deposits. The presence of calcific deposits was verified using TEM imaging and a dual histological staining approach consisting of Von Kossa and degraded collagen staining. We thus elucidate the nanoscale mechanical heterogeneity in AAA which can be attributed in part to collagen fibrils and calcific deposits.","Engineering, Biomedical",Nano-mechanical mapping of human and porcine abdominal aortic aneurysm,,[]

To address this unmet clinical need, we herein report a polymeric nano-spy (RAFP NP) that can activate its near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence and release therapeutic drug in response to specific early-stage stimuli within the DOP environment for the diagnosis and treatment of DOP. RAFP NPs are self-assembled from an integrin-targeted and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive amphiphilic copolymer (PLGA-TK-cRGD) that encapsulates the nearinfrared fluorochrome Cy5 and the anti-ferroptosis drug Fer-1. Such structural design allows RAFP NPs to actively target the DOP region through specific interaction with the overexpressed integrin alpha v beta 3 receptors and undergo the elevated ROS to induce the cleavage of thioketal (TK) moiety. Subsequently, RAFP NPs decompose to release Cy5 for NIR fluorescence imaging of DOP, while concurrently releasing Fer-1 to suppress osteoblast ferroptosis, promote osteogenesis, and ultimately reverse DOP progression.

One of the earliest and most common changes seen in cancer is abnormal DNA methylation at CpG sites, which may encourage tumor development by silencing tumor suppressor gene transcription. The DNMT1 inhibitor AZA can delay cancer progression by inhibiting DNA methylation and enhancing tumor immunogenicity, yet its clinical efficacy in gastric cancer is limited by poor specificity, instability, and low retention. To address this, we developed a light-triggered engineered microbe, AM@Ec, utilizing Escherichia coli (MG1655) as a carrier that selectively targets the tumor microenvironment (TME). This system delivers Mo1.33C-AZA to the tumor core, enhancing anti-tumor efficacy through DNA methylation inhibition. Additionally, iMXene (Mo1.33C) demonstrates outstanding CT imaging and photothermal properties, making it suitable for photothermal therapy (PTT), and synergize with epigenetic regulation to enhance apoptosis in gastric cancer cells. This approach also triggers immunogenic cell death, promotes dendritic cell maturation, reshapes the TME, and activates systemic immunity, generating immune memory to prevent metastasis. Furthermore, epigenomic and transcriptomic analyses confirmed that the combined treatment not only significantly reduced methylation levels within tumor tissues but also effectively activated immune cell-related transcriptional pathways to promote anti-tumor immune responses.

In vitro, CD47-VE-M coatings significantly promoted EC adhesion (3.4-fold increase vs. bare-metal stent (BMS) (p < 0.001)), directional migration (accelerated 62 % compared to BMS at 24 h) and proliferation (2.3-fold increase vs. BMS (p < 0.01)), with increased VE-cadherin expression and improved tight junction formation (1.5-fold higher than BMS (p < 0.001)).

This transformation enhances cellular uptake and enables selective scavenging of hydrogen sulfide (H2S)-a metabolite that promotes glycolysis in cancer cells and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in TAMs. Local H2S depletion by FZNCs induces a bidirectional metabolic shift: cancer cells are redirected from glycolysis to OXPHOS, while TAMs switch from OXPHOS to glycolysis. This dual reprogramming enhances tumor immunogenicity with increased dendritic cell maturation and M1 polarization in vitro, and enhanced cytotoxic T-cell infiltration in vivo.

Acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) with neuroprotective properties holds significant promise for promoting SCI repair. However, challenges of aFGF related to short blood circulation time, susceptibility to degradation, and severely restricted ability to cross blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) have hindered further exploration and utilization in SCI. In order to overcome these challenges, this study elaborately fabricated an innovative aFGF bionic intelligent delivery nanomedicine (abbreviated as aFGFND) via free radical polymerization technology to form a multifunctional thin polymer film on the surface of aFGF. The presence of this film enhanced aFGF's resistance against protease K degradation. In addition, hydrophilic polyethylene glycol (PEG) groups incorporated within the film contributed to extending the blood circulating time. Importantly, microvascular endothelial cells abundant with choline transporter (ChT) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) could actively recognize and capture aFGFND based on choline analogues on the thin film to effectively facilitate drug to cross BSCB. Finally, under stimulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in damaged site, the phenylboronic ester bonds within the protective layer underwent degradation and subsequently released the loaded aFGF to exert neuroprotective effects. By efficiently enriching and native protein drug releasing, the repair efficiency of aFGF on SCI was significantly enhanced, including strengthening the inhibitory effect on the inflammatory microenvironment, reducing neuronal apoptosis, and promoting axonal and neural regeneration.

Acoustic assembly has emerged as a powerful technology for modular units' assembly, leveraging sound waves to achieve rapid, contactless spatial arrangement by fine-tuning parameters such as frequency, amplitude, and chamber geometry. Here we present a system that employs acoustic waves to generate spatial patterns of liquid-core microcapsules, encapsulating poly-caprolactone surface-functionalized microparticles and umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells. The microcapsules were produced using electrohydrodynamic atomization in conjugation with an aqueous two-phase system and subsequently embedded in gelatin methacrylate. Acoustic waves were then applied to assemble the liquid-core microcapsules in well-defined patterns within the hydrogel precursor followed by crosslinking for structural stability. This approach allows us to define spatial patterns with precision, aligning with simulation predictions. The liquid nature of the microcapsules' core permits the organization of cells within the space towards the formation of microtissues decoupled from the external environment. The patterned constructs maintained cell viability for 14 days, facilitating the formation of microaggregates within liquid-core microcapsules and maintained organized microstructures.

However, excessive copper induces a distinctive form of cell death, termed cuproptosis which compromises the biocompatibility of copper-based biomaterials. Cuproptosis relies on oxidative phosphorylation and can be inhibited by the Warburg effect, which is the characteristic of aerobic glycolysis in tumor cells. Therefore, nitric oxide (NO), an endogenous signaling molecule that promotes glycolysis and osteogenesis, may potentially inhibit cuproptosis and promote bone repair in copper-based biomaterials. In this study, a Cu-MOF encapsulating L-arginine was synthesized, capable of sustaining NO release through NOS catalysis and H2O2 consumption. It was found to inhibit the cuproptosis and synergistically promote osteogenesis. Multi-omics analyses revealed that this effect is primarily mediated by upregulating glutathione (GSH) synthesis, downregulating the GABA shunt, and enhancing aerobic glycolysis.

This study confirms the extensive iron accumulation and ferroptosis occurrence in diabetic oral ulcers. To address this, an oral patch (PLTP) is designed by combining two natural bioactive molecules of lipoic acid (LA) and tea polyphenols (TP). The abundant carboxyl and hydroxyl groups in PLTP act as iron ion capturers, adsorbing extracellular iron, reducing iron transport into cells, and effectively cutting off the iron source for intracellular ferroptosis. The in-situ release of LA and TP at wound site not only aids in restoring intercellular iron homeostasis via regulating the intracellular Xc-/GPX4 axis, enhancing antioxidant capacity, upregulating the expression of SLC40A1, and downregulating the expression of DMT1, but also modulates the immune microenvironment, further supporting wound healing. In addition, PLTP exhibits a robust adhesion strength of 14.32 kPa to oral mucosa even after 24 h of vigorous stirring in an iron-rich solution in vitro, and maintains prolonged adhesion in the moist and dynamic oral cavity for over 24 h in vivo. This effectively protects ulcer sites from bacterial invasion and food debris contamination. In vivo experiments show that PLTP significantly accelerates diabetic oral ulcer healing, achieving 92.4 % wound closure by day 8, outperforming both commercial chitosan patches (53.7 %) and the anti-ferroptosis drug Deferasirox (60.0 %).

In this study, a biomimetic ""gas-gene"" strategy was proposed to enhance anti-liver fibrosis efficacy. A macrophage membrane-coated carbon nitride-based biomimetic delivery platform loaded with DNA nanoparticles (M-PEISeCCNs@DNA) was developed. The macrophage membrane coating facilitated the delivery of M-PEISeCCNs@SBP1 to the liver fibrosis site and reversed the positive charge of the carriers to avoid cation-induced cytotoxicity. Under near-infrared (NIR) irradiation, M-PEISeCCNs@SBP1 could trigger water splitting to produce O2, thereby mitigating hypoxia and alleviating liver fibrosis. The light-responsive release of the SBP1-DNA plasmid was also achieved through carrier photolysis. The delivered SBP1-DNA and the Se element within the vectors synergistically upregulated the expression of selenium-binding protein-1 (SBP1). Additionally, we demonstrated for the first time that SBP1 is an effective therapeutic target for liver fibrosis, and its overexpression inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and attenuates CCl4-induced liver fibrosis in mice. In this experiment, M-PEISeCCNs@SBP1 effectively treated liver fibrosis in mice through the SBP1-mediated NOTCH2/Wnt pathway.","Engineering, Biomedical",Macrophage membrane-coated NIR light-photodegradable carbon nitride-based gene vectors for gas-gene therapy of liver fibrosis,,[]
,1,2026-01-01,BIOACTIVE MATERIALS,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most concerned aging-related diseases in the worldwide, yet the investigation of immune senescence in joint and related therapies are still poorly identified. Single-cell sequencing analysis and immunofluorescence of OA synovium reveal increased senescent macrophages in trauma-induced OA compared to controls. Importantly, senescent macrophages in OA synovium showed enhanced M1 polarization, mitochondrial damage and impaired efferocytosis, which could lead to increased senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASPs) in the joint and further exacerbate OA. Hence, a novel senotherapeutic nanoparticle is developed using chloroquine (CQ)-bearing polymers (pCQ) for targeted delivery of superoxide dismutase (SOD) to synovial macrophages, termed as pCQ/SOD. The nanoparticle achieves efficient intracellular delivery of SOD to synovial macrophages. RNA-seq results reveal that pCQ/SOD nanoparticle inhibits macrophage senescence via p53 and cellular senescence signaling pathway, further reprograms M1-to-M2 repolarization. Furthermore, the delivered SOD inhibits BAX-dependent mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) which further reduces mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) release and SASP secretion, while pCQ promotes macrophage efferocytosis against apoptotic cells via STAT3/ADAM17/MerTK signaling. As a result, intraarticular injection of pCQ/SOD nanoparticles in mice successfully alleviates not only trauma-induced OA, but aging-induced OA as well. The developed senotherapeutic nanoparticle in this study offers an effective approach for remodeling of senescent macrophages in synovium and a promising therapeutic strategy for OA treatment.","Engineering, Biomedical",Remodeling of senescent macrophages in synovium alleviates trauma-and aging-induced osteoarthritis,,[]

Understanding and controlling this relationship offers valuable insights into fundamental cellular processes and potential strategies for cell engineering. While this phenomenon is well known, direct evidence of how dynamic external physical cues regulate chromatin structure has remained elusive. This study presents a method to dynamically regulate chromatin architecture using photo-switchable pDR1m-based mechano-modulating surfaces. Through in-situ photo-patterning and erasure of surface nanogratings, we achieved spatiotemporal regulation of the intensity and distribution of cytoskeletal forces transmitted to the nuclear envelope and reversible nuclear deformations in MCF10A cells. These nanotopography induced cytoskeletal forces facilitated the modulation of chromatin compaction and spatial reorganization of heterochromatin domains. Therefore, our findings establish a dynamic, reversible platform to manipulate chromatin organization and control cell activity, elucidating the dynamic interplay between the cytoskeleton, nucleus, and chromatin as mediated by cell-material interactions.","Engineering, Biomedical",Regulation of nuclear deformation via spatiotemporal modulation of cytoskeleton forces on photo-switchable surfaces,,[]

FFF process parameters determine the mechanical performance of final printed parts; hence, optimizing for appropriate levels of strength is critical for load-bearing applications. We utilized a Taguchi L-9 orthogonal array to investigate the impact of nozzle temperature (TN), chamber temperature (TCh), layer height (LH), and print speed (PS) on the compressive properties of cylindrical polyetherether-ketone (PEEK) and polyether-ketone-ketone (PEKK). The printed specimens were examined using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry to understand the effect of the printing parameters on their macrostructures. The optimized parameter combination for the elastic modulus (E) of PEEK and PEKK was 390 degrees C TN, (190 degrees C-PEEK, 110 degrees C-PEKK) TCh, 0.1 mm LH, and 1000 mm/min PS, with LH and PS having the most impact on their stiffness. For the offset yield strength (YS), the optimized parameters were (410 degrees C-PEEK, 400 degrees C-PEKK) TN, (210 degrees C-PEEK, 150 degrees C-PEKK) TCh, 0.1 mm LH, and (1000 mm/min-PEEK, 1500 mm/min-PEKK) PS, with TN, TCh, and LH significantly impacting both materials. Elevated thermal conditions enhanced the strength of both materials; however, in PEEK, this was achieved by slowing down its crystallization kinetics, while in PEKK, it increased tendency for crystallization. The print conditions significantly affected the crystallinity of PEKK but not PEEK. Additionally, the highest E of PEEK and PEKK were 113 % and 106 % of the expected value of unreinforced PEEK (3.3 GPa), whereas the highest YS were 132 % and 120 % higher (94 MPa), respectively, indicating PEKK's potential for spinal cage applications.","Engineering, Biomedical",Optimization of fused filament fabrication process parameters to improve the compressive properties of PEEK and PEKK biomaterials,,[]

In this work, ""sandwich"" structured nanorods were constructed on Zn substrate with ZnO nanorods as core, riboflavin-encapsulated ZIF-8 as intermediate layer and HA as outer shell. Under normal physiological condition, ZIF-8 and HA reduce degradation of Zn substrate, decreasing Zn2+ release. ZIF-8 and riboflavin scavenge extracellular and intracellular ROS, respectively, achieving antioxidant therapy and establishing antiinflammatory microenvironment via promoting M1 macrophages to polarize toward M2 phenotype. The synergistic effect of Zn2+, riboflavin as well as cytokines secreted by macrophages up-regulates the vitality and biological functions of BMSCs, HUVECs and PC-12 cells in vitro. When bacteria invade, they secrete hyaluronidase and organic acids to decompose HA and ZIF-8 sequentially, releasing a mass of Zn2+, which increases bacterial membrane permeability and induces intracellular ROS production and protein leakage, leading to bacterial death.

Here, we develop an injectable Mn3O4-enhanced hydrogel (GM/OD/Mn3O4) to address this. Mn3O4 nanosheets, firstly synthesized via biomineralization, exhibit high photothermal efficiency and enzyme-mimetic activity (glucose oxidase/peroxidase-like). The hydrogel adapts to irregular defects and releases Mn3O4 in acidic tumor microenvironments. Through catalytic cascades, it depletes ATP and inhibits heat shock proteins, overcoming tumor thermoresistance and enabling effective ablation at mild temperatures (43 degrees C). Lower NIR power (40 degrees C) further enhances osteogenesis.

Herein, a high hydrogen storage nanoquadruplex (PdH0.2)4Se based on a palladium-selenium core has been designed and shows enhanced intratumoral accumulation via an enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. High-efficiency hydrogen can be released from (PdH0.2)4Se, activated by near infrared irradiation (NIR), and combines with available selenium (Se) to produce highly toxic hydrogen selenide (H2Se), which in turn unbalances the GSH/GSSG ratio and induces ROS overproduction. The effect demonstrates that (PdH0.2)4Se irradiated by NIR significantly inhibits cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis in vitro. Furthermore, irradiation of (PdH0.2)4Se by NIR can induce significant ferroptosis of cancer cells by triggering mitochondrial dysfunction, ROS generation and lipid peroxidation-mediated oxidative damage in vitro. Finally, NIR irradiated (PdH0.2)4Se also exhibits tumor-targeted photothermal imaging, and inhibition of tumor growth in vivo activating cancer ferroptosis. Importantly, (PdH0.2)4Se demonstrates excellent safety and biocompatibility in vitro and in vivo.

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) significantly impedes therapeutic drug delivery, contributing to treatment resistance and poor prognosis with GBM. As a choline analogue, 2-methylacryloxyethyl phosphocholine (MPC) has been identified to cross the BBB by binding to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and choline transporters (ChTs) on the surface of the brain endothelial cells. In this study, aiming at utilizing this unique property to realize targeted drug delivery to brain tumors, a novel poly(2-methylacryloxyethyl phosphocholine) (pMPC-CHO)-based pH-responsive nanoparticles (NPs) drug delivery system (DDS) was developed via a simple strategy. By copolymerizing MPC monomer and oligo-poly(ethylene glycol) monomer containing aldehyde group to form a hydrophilic shell and synthesizing amphiphilic chitosan polymer-paclitaxel conjugate as the core, pH-responsive nano DDS (PC/M NPs) were obtained. pMPC-CHO enhances biocompatibility and BBB crossing ability. In the tumor microenvironment, PC/M NPs release positively charged chitosan NPs due to the broken imine bond, promoting cancer cell uptake and transcytosis, and then intracellular glutathione (GSH) activates paclitaxel to kill tumor cells.

This study introduces photoinitiated chemical vapor deposition (piCVD) as a transformative approach to neural interface stability through ultrathin (<100 nm) antifouling coatings. Unlike conventional hydrogel coatings that impair electrical signal transmission, our piCVDapplied poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate-co-ethylene glycol dimethacrylate) coating maintains electrical functionality by preserving low impedance while providing superior anti-fouling properties. In vitro protein adsorption studies demonstrated near-complete resistance to both albumin and fibrinogen compared to uncoated surfaces, with the coating maintaining stability even after 24 h of sonication-durability unachievable with conventional wet-chemistry methods. When evaluated in mouse models over three months, the coated probe maintained high-quality spontaneous neural recordings and optically evoked potentials throughout the study period, with signal-to-noise ratios improving from 18.0 at week 1-20.7 at week 13. This performance significantly correlates with 66.6 % reduction in glial scarring, 84.6 % increase in neuronal preservation compared to uncoated probes. The specific combination of CVD methodology and optimized copolymer composition achieves long-term stability, representing a significant advance over the typical one-month limitation of conventional coatings.

However, current treatment strategies primarily focus on addressing MI, often neglecting the detrimental effects of hyperglycemia, a hallmark of diabetes. Hyperglycemia disrupts the crucial transition of macrophages from the M1 to M2 phenotype, thereby exacerbating MI-induced tissue damage and impeding myocardial repair. Mitochondria have emerged as key regulators of macrophage phenotype, suggesting the potential for modulating macrophages through mitochondria transfer. In this study, we developed microvesicles containing active mitochondria (Mito@euMVs), derived from enucleated mesenchymal stem cells.

However, conventional ER stress inducers are largely limited by hypoxia and off-target effects to induce tumour-lethal ER stress. Here, we encapsulated Cu-bridged eosin Y (CuBY) in ER-targeting peptide (pardaxin)-modified mesoporous silica and successfully constructed an oxygen-independent multifunctional copper-light synergistic prodrug nanosystems (MP@CuBY). MP@CuBY is activated to the ""on"" state within the glutathione-overexpressing tumour microenvironment, causing copper and BY release. Interestingly, released copper can drive oxygen-independent cascade reactions in situ in the ER, resulting in the production of highly toxic O2- center dot and center dot OH.

Nevertheless, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments (TME) are believed to hinder DC maturation, leading to a significant decrease in the effectiveness of immunotherapy. In this work, we present the first instance of combining ROS-triggered immunogenic cell death (ICD), cholesterol depletion, and STING activation to achieve the cascade amplification of antitumor immune response. The Zr-based metal-organic frameworks (MOF) is utilized as the template for the synthesis of hollow MnO2 (H-MnO2). Carbon dots (CDs) with cholesterol depletion capability are then deposited on H-MnO2 to form heterojunctions. CD@H-MnO2 not only has improved ROS generation ability under ultrasound due to heterojunction construction, but also shows GSH-responsive degradation properties, enabling the targeted release of CDs and Mn ions in tumors. CD@H-MnO2-triggered cascade amplification of antitumor immune response is elucidated as follows: (1) Heterojunction construction, GSH depletion, and relief of hypoxia co-augmented ROS yield could significantly induce a robust ICD effect. (2) The released Mn ions stimulate DC maturation by activating the cGAS-STING pathway. (3) Direct enhancement of T cell toxicity can be realized by CDs through depleting cholesterol.

Previous CD47SIRP alpha checkpoint blockage strategies based on monoclonal antibodies or nanoparticles have shown significant pro-efferocytosis effects and thus improved the inflammatory microenvironment of plaque. However, apoptotic foam cells and concentrated cholesterol render plaque macrophages an overwhelming lipid burden, limiting the pro-efferocytosis effect of checkpoint blockade therapy in atherosclerosis. In this study, we fabricate a retinoic acid-loaded macrophage membrane-biomimetic liposome (R@MLP) to improve the efferocytosis ability of macrophages further. Mechanistically, the innate existence of SIRP alpha on the R@MLP would block the binding of CD47 on apoptotic cells with SIRP alpha on macrophages to realize the CD47-SIRP alpha inhibition. Consequently, engulfing retinoic acid in R@MLP would upregulate the expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1 of macrophages and enhance cholesterol efflux. In the mouse model of atherosclerosis, which benefited from the macrophage membrane, R@MLP showed ideal inflammation targeting ability to plaques and further reinforced the efferocytosis ability of macrophages. Ultimately, R@MLP shifted macrophages to the anti-inflammatory state and attenuated the progression of atherosclerosis.

,0,2026-01-01,BIOACTIVE MATERIALS,"Inflammatory responses triggered by foreign body rejection or detached wear particles are major contributors to the failure of titanium (Ti)-based orthopedic implants. One of the most common complications is aseptic loosening. To address this challenge, a nanorod-arrayed hydroxyapatite (HA) coating co-doped with multiple ions (Sr2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, CO32- , and SiO44- ) was developed, to mimic the bone matrix and enhance immunoosteogenesis. The coating exhibits strong adhesion strength and long-term interfacial stability. Ion-induced lattice distortion accelerates HA degradation, promoting the doped-ion release. These bioactive ions drive macrophage (Mks) polarization from pro-inflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, thereby enhancing vascularized osseointegration. To evaluate the risk of aseptic loosening induced by detached nanorods, we synthesized nanorod-like particles with identical composition and morphology to those in the arrayed coating. Their effects on Mk polarization and the underlying mechanisms were then systematically investigated. Compared to undoped particles, multi-ion doped HA nanoparticles are more easily phagocytosed and degraded within lysosomes, enabling faster ion release and thereby facilitating M1-M2 transition. Transcriptomic analysis reveals that the nanoparticle degradation-mediated ion release elevates intracellular calcium levels in Mks, which activates antioxidant pathways and induces a metabolic shift toward fatty acid oxidation. This metabolic reprogramming subsequently activates immunoregulatory pathways, with the PPAR pathway serving as a central axis, thereby promoting M2 polarization, inhibiting osteoclastogenesis, and ultimately preventing aseptic loosening. Collectively, this study presents a coating design that not only promotes osseointegration but also retains anti-inflammatory potential even in the event of particle detachment, offering a promising strategy to mitigate aseptic loosening.","Engineering, Biomedical",Bone matrix-mimetic multi-ion doped hydroxyapatite nanorod arrays for enhanced immuno-osteogenesis and prevention of aseptic loosening,,[]
,1,2026-03-01,BIOMATERIALS,"Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), major components of the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) tumor microenvironment, affect tumor growth and limit the therapeutic efficacy of various clinical approaches by forming a dense stromal physical barrier, inducing chemo-resistance and promoting a tumor-immunosuppressive microenvironment. Therefore, therapeutic strategies based on targeted modulation of CAFs are promising in the treatment of TNBC. However, precise targeting of CAFs faces difficulties due to the lack of specific markers for CAFs. Here, we designed a nanoparticle co-modified with anisamide and CAF cell membrane (CAFm) to load tetrandrine as a CAF nano-regulator (TET@ACNP), which is able to precisely target and modulate CAFs. Precise targeting of CAFs was achieved by the combination of the CAFm homing effect as well as the high affinity effect between anisamide and sigma receptors overexpressed on CAFs. TET@ACNP was able to inhibit CAFs activation and reduce collagen secretion, thereby breaking the physical barrier to facilitate the penetration of the first-line chemotherapeutic agent docetaxel (DTX) and the infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. In addition, TET@ACNP alleviates chemoresistance by inhibiting the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway and inhibits IGF2 expression to release the immunosuppressive microenvironment, ultimately enhancing chemotherapy effects and anti-tumor immunity. Our study proposes a comprehensive therapeutic strategy based on the precise targeting and regulation of CAFs in combination with chemotherapy to achieve multifaceted inhibition of TNBC. This is expected to be a universal platform to improve the therapeutic efficacy of different chemotherapeutic agents in various types of stroma-rich tumors.","Engineering, Biomedical",Precision targeted cancer-associated fibroblast nano-regulator enhanced chemo-immunotherapy for triple-negative breast cancer,,[]

However, the clinical application of AGF is limited by challenges like secondary trauma and flap inactivation. In this study, a three-dimensional printed tissue engineering biomimetic gingival flap (BGF) was designed to replace AGF by fully mimicking the composition, structure, and function of gingiva. The micropatterned gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) modified with epsilon-polylysine can effectively reduce the risk of bacterial infection and reestablish the gingival barrier, while the porous GelMA can rebuild fiber networks. Promoting osteogenesis and membrane barrier functions are achieved by the dense zinc-rich GelMA. This study precisely constructed a three-layer BGF, whose surface featured a microscale honeycomb microstructure with an error of less than 1.5 %, and the middle layer was a controllable porous structure with adjustable pore sizes ranging from 10 to 70 mu m. BGF exhibited broad-spectrum antibacterial activity with a bacteriostatic rate of approximately 90%, function of promoting the regeneration of multiple tissues, and long-term membrane barrier function lasting at least 30 days. Furthermore, BGF accelerated soft tissue healing by 167.95 % and bone healing by 84.36 % in vivo through activating the paracrine effect of fibroblasts. BGF is expected to provide a more effective solution for implant patients with bone and soft tissue defects.","Engineering, Biomedical",Biomimetic gingival hydrogel promotes the integrated repair of peri-implant gingiva and bone by mobilizing multiple cells,,[]
,3,2026-01-01,BIOMATERIALS,"Breast cancer treatment remains challenging due to the dense, fibrotic tumor microenvironment (TME), which is dominated by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), hinders drug delivery and promotes therapy resistance. While photothermal therapy (PTT) can induce localized tumor ablation, its efficacy is often limited by poor nano-particle penetration and CAF-mediated immune suppression. Here, we developed M@P-WIs, a biomimetic nanoplatform that combines PTT with targeted CAF modulation. Unlike conventional approaches, M@P-WIs co-deliver a photothermal agent (IR-780) and the discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2) inhibitor WRG-28, enabling simultaneous tumor cell ablation and stromal remodeling. In preclinical studies, this dual-action strategy significantly suppressed metastasis, induced CAF apoptosis, and dismantled the fibrotic barrier while preventing CAF repopulation. In murine breast cancer models, M@P-WIs achieved complete primary tumor regression and established long-term immunological memory, thereby reducing recurrence and metastasis. Importantly, we have identified a novel resistance mechanism, by which PTT alone triggers residual tumor cells to secrete TGF beta-rich exosomes, promoting fibroblast-to-CAF transformation and excessive ECM deposition. M@P-WIs effectively overcome this resistance mechanism by producing complete CAF depletion alongside tumor ablation. Our findings demonstrate that integrating CAF-targeted stromal modulation with PTT synergistically enhances therapeutic efficacy, offering a promising strategy for treating stroma-rich, aggressive tumors.","Engineering, Biomedical",Biomimetic nanoplatforms for combined DDR2 inhibition and photothermal therapy in dense breast cancer treatment,,[]

Current treatment options are limited and often yield unfavorable outcomes. Given that tendons are highly mechanosensitive tissues, recent studies highlight the crucial role of mechanotransduction in tissue repair. Piezo1, a mechanosensitive ion channel, has been recognized as a crucial factor attributing to many pathological processes in various tissues, but its specific role in tendon healing has not been previously explored. This study aimed to investigate the potential therapeutic benefits of GsMTx4-loaded GelMA on tendon regeneration and the prevention of heterotopic ossification following injury. Our findings indicate that following tendon injuries, Piezo1 expression was elevated. Activation of Piezo1 with Yoda1 suppressed osteogenic differentiation while promoting chondrogenic differentiation of tendon-derived stem cells. Treatment with GsMTx4 enhanced tendon healing and mitigated the formation of heterotopic ossification. RNA sequencing further implicated the Apelin signaling pathway in these processes, and inhibition of this pathway using ML221 significantly suppressed HO formation, suggesting a pivotal role for Apelin in tendon healing and ossification. Additionally, short-term immobilization was found to attenuate heterotopic ossification by modulating Piezo1 activity. Thus, inhibition of Piezo1 enhances tendon healing and reduces heterotopic ossification, potentially through the Apelin signaling pathway. These results underscore the critical role of Piezo1 in tendon biology and highlight the potential of targeting mechanosensitive ion channels, especially Piezo1, as a novel therapeutic approach for promoting tendon regeneration and preventing heterotopic ossification.","Engineering, Biomedical",GsMTx4-loaded GelMA promotes tendon regeneration and suppresses heterotopic ossification via the Apelin signaling pathway,,[]

Photothermal therapy (PTT), which utilizes a photothermal agent (PTA) to generate localized heat, presents a promising approach that effectively eliminates pathogens while minimizing tissue damage, thereby enhancing treatment safety and efficacy. However, challenges such as low photothermal conversion efficiency and biocompatibility issues persist. In this study, we developed hemin chloride-modified organic small molecule-based nanoparticles (PTA@Hemin NPs). This material demonstrates exceptional photothermal effects with 81 % photothermal conversion efficiency and excellent biocompatibility. Under nearinfrared (NIR) laser irradiation, the PTA@Hemin NPs generate strong photothermal effects, which synergize with the inherent antibacterial properties of hemin to significantly enhance the eradication of free bacteria and biofilms. Furthermore, PTA@Hemin NPs effectively scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) and alleviate inflammation by downregulating the expression of pro-inflammatory factors such as Cd86 and Il-1 alpha, reducing M1 macrophage polarization. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed that PTA@Hemin NPs significantly enhance antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects, while facilitating scarless healing of maxillofacial wounds in mice. These results highlight the potential of PTA@Hemin NPs as a highly effective strategy for treating bacterial infections, particularly those involving biofilms, in future clinical applications.","Engineering, Biomedical",Efficient organic nanoparticles for photothermal antibacterial activity and immune regulation to promote maxillofacial wound healing and scarless repair,,[]

The limited efficacy of current therapies highlights the urgent need for novel approaches targeting key pathological mechanisms. Excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and resulting cascade of amplified inflammatory responses is a key factor in the progression of ALI/ARDS. Herein, we successfully regulated the immune homeostasis-mediated inflammatory response to alleviate ALI based on the inhalable CoAl-LDH (CAL) nanosheets with good biocompatibility and exciting ROS scavenging capabilities. Transcriptomic analysis combined with single-cell sequencing reanalysis revealed, for the first time, that CAL binds to damaged DNA and effectively inhibits the cGAS-STING pathway-mediated inflammatory response. Furthermore, incorporating the cGAS-STING pathway inhibitor C176 into CAL greatly enhanced this inhibition to reduce inflammation and mitigate the lung tissue damage. These results suggest that regulation of immune homeostasis with multifunctional nanosheets may be a promising paradigm for managing ALI/ARDS in clinical settings.","Engineering, Biomedical",Regulation of cGAS-STING pathway with inhalable nanozyme in acute lung injury,,[]

Utilizing the rapid gelation of carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) and oxidized xyloglucan (OXG), COTF hydrogels load with TA-Fe complexes, whose photothermal effect can significantly enhance the ferroptosis-like death characteristics and effectively decompose the biofilm structure. Furthermore, COTF can reduce M2 macrophages in iron-deficient microenvironments, remodeling immunosuppression. Eventually, a surgical standard operating procedure (SOP) is developed, which simply requires sequentially brushing or spraying the prosthesis with the fore-mentioned four chemical solutions, in order to achieve antibiofilm efficacy and implant preservation. Eventually, validations in acute and chronic PJI models confirm the preventive and therapeutic effects of ""Restauro"" strategy, hence building a new bridge from bench to bedside for future PJI treatments.","Engineering, Biomedical","""Restauro"" strategy: Siderophore-like antibiofilm coating combats prosthetic joint infection and preserves implants via bacterial ferroptosis-like death",,[]

In this study, for the first time a leucine derivate LLOMe (L-leucyl-L-leucine methyl ester) was repurposed to the adjuvant to reinforce the immune responses of lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-based peptide vaccine. Mechanistically, LLOMe disrupted the lysosomal entrapment of vaccine thus effectively enhanced bioavailability of antigens. Moreover, LLOMe in vaccine was found to stimulate the functional level of APCs via mTOR programed metabolism, while mTOR inhibitor rapamycin could abolish the adjuvating effect of LLOMe. In various animal tumor models receiving prophylactic or therapeutic vaccinations adjuvanted by LLOMe, the effective suppression of tumor growth was achieved through enhanced delivery of antigens and modulation of cellular immune responses.

Understanding how vibrations propagate through the hand is a key area of research involved in preventing these disorders. Within this, it is essential to grasp the mechanical behaviour of hand intrinsic muscles, especially as their properties may change during gripping due to muscular contraction. In order to achieve this objective, a homemade setup was elaborated with a view to measuring the mechanical characteristics of the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle, which is located between the thumb and index finger. The apparatus featured quasi-static indentation, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), and shear wave elastography to investigate muscle hyperelastic, viscoelastic, and anisotropic properties, respectively. Measurements were conducted on 27 volunteers with grip instructions ranging from 0 to 40% of their maximal grip strength. The use of repeated measures analysis of variance and the computation of cross-correlations between the proposed measurement techniques unveiled that grip forces significantly modulate the mechanical behaviour of the FDI muscle. In addition, our results emphasised that the FDI muscle stiffened as grip force increased, primarily in the direction longitudinal to muscle fibres. The muscle static stiffness also rose non-linearly with the indenter penetration, thus exhibiting the hyperelastic behaviour of living tissues. The muscle dynamic stiffness was found to be strongly reshaped by vibration frequencies. It remained roughly constant up to around 100 Hz (when no grip), then climbed steeply. Grip force revealed its greatest influence on the muscle dynamic stiffness for vibrations with frequencies ranging from 20 Hz to approximately 300 Hz: the greater the grip force, the higher the dynamic stiffness. Furthermore, the FDI muscle was shown to exhibit a four-to six-fold increase in mechanical power dissipation between 20 Hz and 80 Hz when the handle was gripped at the maximum tested force, in comparison to no grip. Elevating grip forces increased vibration dissipated power within the hand muscles, thereby arguably leading to what are possibly the foremost vibration-induced risks.","Engineering, Biomedical",Mechanical characterisation of hand first dorsal interosseous muscle during gripping,,[]

Here, we developed a wireless wearable healthcare device fabricated using bulk and hollow gold nanowires (Ag@AuNW and AuHNW) with distinct electrical properties. The strain sensor based on AuHNW showed high sensitivity (Delta R/R0 = 773.07 at 100 %) and the Ag@AuNW-based temperature sensor showed superior temperature sensitivity (0.296 % oC-1). Both sensors exhibited remarkable selectivity with minimal cross-sensitivity to strain, pressure, and temperature, and the heater remained stable under mechanical deformation (Delta T = 1.61 degrees C at 20 % strain). In particular, the nanomaterials in the system showed high biocompatibility with high cell viability over 90 %, and robust stability under chemical (immersion in oxidative and humid) and mechanical (2000 cycles of stretching) test conditions.

Accumulation of brown fat enhances energy expenditure and could be a strategy to fight obesity. While approaches to induce browning in animals for therapeutic purposes have been tested, clinically applicable options are limited. Here, we propose chemically induced in vivo brown adipogenic reprogramming for the therapeutic application of brown adipocytes. By phenotypic screening, we identified a novel combination of two small molecules, SB431542 (SB) and NKH477 (NK), a TGF beta inhibitor and a cAMP activator, respectively, that could reprogram mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to adipocyte-like cells with brown/beige adipocyte properties. We demonstrated that the expression of both Ppar gamma and Cebp beta via TGF beta inhibition and cAMP activation is essential for the increased activation of UCP1 due to the synergistic effects of SB and NK combination (SBNK) on adipogenesis. We further demonstrated the potential clinical application of this in vivo brown adipogenic reprogramming by showing that high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice treated intraperitoneally with the SBNK exhibited enhanced browning capacity and were protected from HFD-induced impairment of glucose metabolism. Finally, microneedle patches embedded with SBNK-loaded nanoparticles were applied to the mice's skin around subcutaneous white adipose tissue to test the efficacy of local delivery, which also showed a browning effect.

A major challenge in studying GB is the lack of in vitro models that accurately replicate the tumor's cellular characteristics observed in vivo, particularly the importance of three-dimensional (3D) models. This study investigated the traction stress exerted by LN229 and T98G human GB cell lines, as well as the HMC3 human microglia cell line, using traction force microscopy. First, cells were cultured on two-dimensional (2D) collagen-coated surfaces and within threedimensional (3D) collagen-based bioactive matrices. Afterward, these cells were extracted and reseeded on flat polyacrylamide gels coated with collagen type I to perform traction force microscopy, thereby directly probing the mechanical memory imparted by their prior 2D or 3D environments. Our findings reveal that GB cells exert substantially higher traction stresses when cultured on 2D collagen-coated surfaces compared to those cultured in 3D bioactive matrices. This underscores the relevance of protein-based bioactive materials, such as collagen scaffolds, in replicating in vivo tumor microenvironments to study GB behavior. Single-cell nanoindentation and focal adhesions quantification were performed to offer mechanistic insights into glioblastoma and microglia cells. Interestingly, in addition to notable differences in traction stresses between cells cultured in 2D and 3D collagen environments, glioblastoma showed significant variation based on the cell type in terms of single-cell stiffness and focal adhesion metrics.

We investigated whether ATT influences the EI and shear modulus measurements of the human tibialis anterior superficial (TA(superficial)) and deep (TA(deep)) compartments. Ultrasound measurements were taken from the TA at rest, near the highest cross-sectional area, in ten physically active adults in the following conditions: without fat layers and with one and two fat layers. The EI and shear modulus of both TA(superficial) and TA(deep) were determined, and the best-fit regression model was calculated to assess the influence of ATT on EI and shear modulus. A repeated measures ANOVA were adopted to investigate the differences in EI and shear modulus in the different fat layers. The ATT was seen to affect the EI of both TA(superficial) (R-2 = 0.58; p < 0.001) and TA(deep) (R-2 = 0.44; p < 0.001). When the thickness of TA(superficial) was summed with ATT, the EI of TA(deep) was also affected but to a less extent (R-2 = 0.25; p = 0.004). No significant influence of ATT on shear modulus was seen for both TA compartments (p >= 0.061). While EI decreased in both TA compartments (p < 0.05), the repeated measures ANOVA revealed that only TA(deep) shear modulus decreased with the addition of two fat layers (p = 0.005). Corrective formula for EI measurements was determined. Thus, while skeletal muscle EI measurements should be corrected for the thickness of subcutaneous adipose tissue as well as the depth of region of interest, shear modulus does not.","Engineering, Biomedical",Effect of adipose and muscle tissue thickness on skeletal muscle echo intensity and passive shear modulus: An ultrasound elastography approach,,[]

Herein, a series of topology scaffolds are developed to culture bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) without additional biochemical stimulators, which can significantly promote paracrine-related cytokines expression through mediating cytoskeleton-related mechanotransduction. Topology scaffolds prove that the paracrine function of BMSCs positively correlates to the limited spreading state of cells, while independent of cell shape or specific topology structures. The enhancement in the paracrine function of BMSCs originates from mechanotransduction-related metabolism reprogramming, dominated by depressing cytoskeleton spreading on topology scaffolds. Up-regulated paracrine-related cytokines can effectively enhance vascularization, inhibit apoptosis, depress inflammatory responses, and promote antiinflammatory cytokines expression.

Concurrently, the hypoxic condition of TME activates CD73-adenosine axis, which promotes tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. Here, a potent tumor immunotherapy platform based on genetically and chemically engineered bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMV) expressing hyaluronidase (HAase) is designed for the targeted delivery of CD73 siRNA (siCD73). This strategy enables initial degradation of HA-rich ECM, thereby enhancing deep tumor penetration and promoting drug retention. Surface modification of OMV with 3-aminophenylboronic acid (PBA) further facilitates sialic acid-mediated tumor targeting and lysosome escape, resulting in a 4.6-fold CD73 inhibition, which suppresses tumor cell and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) migration, invasion, and adhesion by downregulating epidermal growth factor receptor, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP2/9), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion. Furthermore, HAase-dependent ECM degradation alleviates deep tumor hypoxia, and inhibits CAFs activation, stromal deposition and angiogenesis by decimating transforming growth factor-beta and VEGF secretion, while the intrinsic immunostimulatory properties of OMV leads to more intensive anti-tumor M1 macrophage polarization, dendritic cell maturation, and natural killer cell and cytotoxic T cell infiltration.

While current biomaterials such as mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) are widely used in vital pulp therapy (VPT), their high cost, challenging handling, and lack of structural flexibility highlight the need for alternatives. Here, we introduce a multifunctional bilayer scaffold composed of a polycaprolactone (PCL) film and a PCL/poly(ethylene oxide) (PCL/PEO) blend loaded with calcium hydroxide (CH), designed to provide both cytoprotection and mineralized tissue regeneration. The scaffold features a compact PCL layer, acting as a barrier to protect the pulp from external cytotoxic agents, and a CH-loaded fibrillar PCL/PEO electrospun layer, aimed at promoting odontoblastic differentiation through sustained calcium ion release. The bilayer structure demonstrated mechanical stability and a degradation profile suitable for clinical application. The release mechanism relies on gradual fiber degradation and CH dissolution. In vitro, the fibrillar layer enhanced calcium ion release, supported dental pulp stem cell adhesion and viability, and stimulated mineralized matrix formation. The compact layer preserved cell viability even in the presence of glass ionomer cement. In vivo, the bilayer scaffold elicited a comparable inflammatory response and expression of dentinogenesis and angiogenesis markers relative to MTA, although it did not attain the same level of mineralized tissue formation.

Ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications, though its role in angiogenesis under hyperglycemia remains unknown. In this study, we revealed a distinct ferroptosisassociated metabolic phenotype in endothelial cells derived from unhealed diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) and under high glucose exposure in vitro, marked by elevated intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and impaired mitochondrial function. Herein, a ferroptosis-modulating hydrogel (TC@BS) was designed to pioneer a 'dual-sink' strategy that concurrently neutralizes tissue iron pool via catechol-iron coordination and augments the angiogenic capacity of endothelial cells through preserving mitochondrial function. In specific, TC@BS exerted multifaceted ferroptosis-inhibitory effects by chelating extracellular iron, attenuating lipid oxidative stress, and maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis in endothelial cells. Utilizing a STZ-induced diabetic mouse model we further demonstrated that TC@BS application significantly accelerated wound healing compared to diabetic wounds, as evidenced by reduced wound area, enhanced neovascularization, and decreased iron accumulation. Mechanistically, PI3K/Akt signaling played a key role to suppress NOX4-dependent lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis following TC@BS administration in iron-rich microenvironments.

The integration of NIR-II FLI and AIE sensitively delineated the thrombus site, providing accurate guidance for thrombolysis. Upon 808 nm laser irradiation, the nanoassembly enabled non-invasive and safe thrombolytic therapy through synergistic photothermal/photodynamic (PTT/PDT) effects and hydrogen peroxide-triggered NO gas therapy (GT). Furthermore, it scavenged 82 % of excessive reactive oxygen species, significantly alleviating oxidative stress-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines production. Consequently, 78 % blood reperfusion was realized, effectively restoring blood flow and preventing re-embolism in carotid thrombosis models. This work presents the first multimodal stimulus-responsive nanoassembly for cascade diagnosis and therapy that integrates NIR-II FLI, PTT, PDT, GT, and antioxidant/anti-inflammatory effects, providing a safe, rapid, and minimally invasive approach for time-critical clinical thrombolysis.","Engineering, Biomedical",Stimulus-responsive AIE nanoassembly for NIR-II imaging-guided cascade photothermal/photodynamic/gas synergistic thrombolysis and vascular healing,,[]

However, their performance has been suboptimal in infectious disease vaccines, which require the induction of both humoral and cellular immunity. Herein, we optimized polycation hydrophobicity to maximize the efficacy of humoral and cellular immunity induction, using biodegradable amphiphilic polyaspartamide derivatives as a platform. The side chains of the polymers contain cationic diethylenetriamine (DET) and hydrophobic 2-cyclohexylethyl (CHE) moieties at varying ratios. Increasing the CHE introduction ratio enhanced immunostimulatory adjuvanticity by activating NLRP3 inflammasome pathway, leading to more efficient activation of cultured dendritic cells. Following subcutaneous injection into mice, polyplexes with higher CHE introduction ratios improved protein expression efficiency in the draining lymph nodes and induced robust germinal center responses. Consequently, antibody responses were enhanced with higher CHE introduction ratios in vaccinations targeting a model antigen and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Furthermore, the vaccination elicited both CD8-positive and CD4-positive T cells in a Th1-skewed manner. In a distribution analysis, protein expression from the delivered mRNA was localized to the injection site and draining lymph nodes, avoiding a safety concern associated with systemic distribution. Collectively, this study demonstrates that the introduction of hydrophobic moieties into polyaspartamide derivatives is an effective and safe strategy to enhance the efficacy of polyplex-based mRNA vaccines targeting infectious diseases.","Engineering, Biomedical",Increasing polycation hydrophobicity in mRNA polyplex vaccines enhances the efficacy of humoral and cellular immunity induction,,[]
,0,2026-01-01,JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS,"Background: Zirconia is an emerging alternative to titanium for dental implant systems. However, zirconia surfaces can deteriorate under aqueous conditions, thereby compromising mechanical performance. The goal of this study was to assess the impact of biological exposure or aging simulating the oral cavity on the surface integrity and mechanical strength of surface-treated zirconia.
Methods: Partially yttria- or magnesia-stabilized zirconia specimens were polished, acid-etched, or sandblasted. Zirconia disks were exposed to mammalian cells or bacteria. Surface degradation via tetragonal-to-monoclinic phase transformation was assessed by Raman microscopy. Zirconia bars were subjected to accelerated aging by exposure to autoclave steam. Surface morphology was examined by scanning electron microscopy, and mechanical strength was measured using four-point bend test loading until failure.
Results: Early-colonizing oral bacteria significantly increased monoclinic content similar to 5-fold on acid-etched yttriastabilized zirconia versus control (p < 0.05). Surface monoclinic content on acid-etched zirconia increased rapidly (54.6 +/- 9.3 %) after 4 h of aging before plateauing (77.0 +/- 5.7 %) after 20 h. In contrast, polished or sandblasted zirconia exhibited minimal monoclinic content (similar to 4 %) after 4 h that gradually increased to similar to 40 % by 20 h. Acid-etching treatment significantly reduced the flexural strength of zirconia (585 +/- 34 MPa) while sandblasting variants were statistically similar (922 +/- 52 MPa) to machined control (921 +/- 74 MPa). Aging reduced the flexural strength of machined or sandblasted zirconia, which was significant (p < 0.05) for machined zirconia (782 +/- 178 MPa).
Conclusions: Acid-etching and/or exposure to acidic environment increase zirconia susceptibility to surface degradation, impacting its surface and mechanical properties.","Engineering, Biomedical",Simulated oral environment affects zirconia aging and mechanical strength,,[]

Decellularization is crucial for producing hTEMs by removing cellular components while preserving ECM integrity. Current detergent decellularization protocols are inadequate for reducing intracellular proteins, some of which are damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Apoptosis could offer an alternative decellularization method for reducing intracellular proteins in hTEMs. We hypothesize that apoptosis-assisted decellularization, combined with hTEM functionalization using the apoptotic secretome, can enhance the remodeling capacity of hTEMs. hTEM-based TEHVs were decellularized using an apoptosis-assisted method and characterized by (immuno-)histology, biochemical assays, biaxial mechanical testing, and mass spectrometry. The apoptotic secretome of human dermal fibroblasts was characterized and used to functionalize hTEMs. Results showed that apoptosis-assisted decellularization met the decellularization standards as well as reduced intracellular proteins and DAMPs with no change in ECM structure and mechanics. Furthermore, the apoptotic secretome functionalization led to an increased tissue repair phenotype in seeded immune cells. TEHVs treated using the apoptosis-assisted decellularization exhibited sustained leaflet functionality in vitro under pulmonary conditions. Apoptosis is a promising strategy to reduce immunogenic DAMPs and introduce biochemical cues that can foster in situ tissue remodeling.","Engineering, Biomedical",Apoptosis as a strategy for enhancing decellularization and remodeling of tissue-engineered heart valves,,[]

Liquid metals (LM), with their unique dynamic atomic rearrangement, high electrical conductivity, and remarkable deformability, exhibit superior catalytic efficiency and penetrability unattainable by conventional catalytic therapies. Herein, we innovatively constructed a biomimetic nanocatalytic system (LM@M) based on Ga67In20.5Sn12.5 coated with tumor cytomembranes. Under ultrasound stimulation, LM@M piezocatalytically decomposes interstitial water in tumors to generate hydrogen, significantly reducing tumor interstitial pressure while simultaneously activating the cGAS-STING immune pathway to enhance antigen presentation and promote T-cell infiltration into deep tumor regions. Experimental results demonstrate that LM@M not only markedly improves drug penetration efficiency in tumor tissues but also induces a robust and sustained antitumor immune response, successfully eliminating both primary and distal metastatic tumors in tumor-bearing mice. This study innovatively integrates the catalytic properties of liquid metals with immunomodulation, unveiling the dynamic deformation behavior of LM-based nanomedicines within the tumor microenvironment, thereby providing a novel strategy for their biomedical applications.","Engineering, Biomedical",Piezoelectric catalytic activation of cGAS-STING pathway by Ga-based liquid metal nanoparticles for enhanced antitumor immunotherapy,,[]

The inhibition of p38 activation in ischemic myocardium can reduce ventricular muscle remodeling post-MI. However, owing to the dynamic change of p38 in ischemic myocardium after MI, the clinical therapeutic effect of p38 inhibitors is insufficient. Herein, we describe the design of a hydrogelator Nap-Phe-Phe-Thr-Gly-Tyr-OH (Nap-TGY) to coassemble the p38 inhibitor SB202190 (SB), a p38 responsive supramolecular hydrogel (Gel Nap-TGY + SB) for local administration and p38 responsive release of SB to efficiently improve the inflammatory microenvironment. Under the overexpression of p38 in ischemic myocardium, Nap-TGY in the hydrogel is phosphorylated to yield hydrophilic Nap-Phe-Phe-Thr (H2PO3)-Gly-Tyr(H2PO3) (Nap-TpGYp), triggering the disassembly of the hydrogel and a responsive release of the inhibitor.

In this study, we construct an endothelium-mimetic coating on vascular stents assisted by metal-phenolic networks (MPNs). The functional components are integrated through a layer-by-layer selfassembly technique with positively charged polyethyleneimine, negatively charged hyaluronic acid (HA), and MPNs composed of epigallocatechin gallate and Cu as a sandwiched assisting interlayer. Vasoactive nitric oxide (NO) released by Cu catalysis along with the glycocalyx major component HA modification on the surface, endow vascular stents with protective functionalities similar to that of natural endothelial cells. The presence of cation-anion electrolytes and polyphenols enhances the loading, stability, and uniformity of the coating through various interactions such as electrostatic adsorption, hydrogen bonding, pi-pi stacking, and covalent crosslinking of phenol-aldehyde-amine. Systematic in-vitro and in-vivo studies demonstrate that this coating significantly reduces platelet adhesion and activation and thrombus formation, selectively promotes endothelial cells proliferation and regulates the behaviour of smooth muscle cells, and mitigates inflammatory responses by the synergistic effects of NO catalytic release and glycocalyx functionalization. In-vivo stent implantation experiment reveals that, compared to bare stents, this coating accelerates stent endothelialization and inhibits intimal hyperplasia of vessels. Three months after implantation, the lumen loss rate of the coated stent is only one-third of that of the bare stent. Overall, the MPNs-assisted construction of multi-layered endothelium-mimetic polyelectrolyte coatings with a dual-modality strategy integrating contact therapy via glycocalyx functionalization and gas therapy via NO generation provides innovative insights for the development of next-generation stents.

However, current research often overlooks the impact of diabetic peripheral neuropathy on hindering wound healing. Here, we develop an adhesive elastomeric wound dressing by combining the natural active molecule lipoic acid (LA) with the clinically applied hypoglycemic drug metformin (Met), integrating the characteristics of remodeling the wound microenvironment and restoring peripheral nerve function, while stabilizing polyLA through the formation of strong salt bridge hydrogen bonds between guanidyl and carboxyl. The surface of the elastomeric dressing rich in adhesive carboxyl groups can achieve effective sealing protection for diabetic wounds by forming multiple hydrogen bonds or electrostatic interactions with the tissues, thereby resisting harmful bacterial invasion. The sustained targeted release of LA and Met at the wound site can effectively reduce local oxidative stress, increase collagen deposition and angiogenesis, and significantly upregulate neuroendocrine chemicals and nerve fiber markers, promoting the recovery of peripheral nerves around the lesion. In the diabetic infection model in rats, the polyLA-Met patch shows a significantly superior wound healing effect compared to the commercial 3M dressing.","Engineering, Biomedical",A poly(lipoic acid)-based elastomer adhesive with synergistic activity of microenvironment regulation and peripheral neuropathy repair facilitates infectious diabetic wound healing,,[]

However, current scaffold-free planar platforms designed to maintain 3D cell structures, including hydrogel-based low-adherence attachment plates, face limitations in handling rare cell samples and achieving high-throughput spheroid formation. We address these challenges by presenting a polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM)-based surface coating designed to promote rapid spheroid formation from individual cancer cells. The coating was developed using a layer-by-layer deposition of poly-L-lysine and poly-L-glutamic acid, with the number of layers adjusted to tailor the surface hydrophilicity, charge neutrality, and mechanical dissipation capacity. The human colorectal carcinoma cell line HCT116 was used to assess the effectiveness of spheroid formation on this coating. When both surface charge neutrality and mechanical dissipation capacity were enhanced, we observed nearly 100 % efficiency in spheroid formation from single cells within three days, surpassing conventional scaffold-free techniques. Spheroid growth on this platform relies on EpCAM and exhibits enhanced expression of stemness and mixed epithelial/mesenchymal markers. The rapid expansion of individual cells on this platform can be utilized for high-throughput ex vivo applications, thereby advancing our understanding of cancer biology and facilitating the development of effective therapies.","Engineering, Biomedical",Spontaneous upregulation of stemness and 3D spheroid formation of single cancer cells induced by scaffold-free polypeptide polyelectrolyte multilayer coating,,[]

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are promising new biocompatible drug carriers; however, their specificity and delivery efficiency remain challenging. In this study, we aimed to develop EVs displaying the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein as a new modality to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. The S proteindisplaying EVs which were the pellet fractions of centrifugation at 10,000xg (S-EVs10K) were found to selectively bind to cells expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Cleavage of the S protein using proteases such as transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) and cathepsins led to successful membrane fusion of the EVs10K with the target cell. Experiments using viral infection inhibitors in TMPRSS2-expressing Vero E6 cells further confirmed the membrane fusion of S-EVs10K in an ACE2-and TMPRSS2-dependent manner. Additionally, we demonstrated the potential of S-EVs10K as novel mRNA carriers to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection by encapsulating the mRNA encoding HAI-2, a TMPRSS2-inhibiting membrane protein. Marked suppression of SARS-CoV2 entry into TMPRSS2-expressing Vero E6 cells was confirmed using pseudotyped virus-like particles.

While covered metal stents can effectively occlude EFs, their long-term implantation may result in migration, in-stent stenosis, and bleeding. Biodegradable covered stents offer temporary support followed by selfdegradation to circumvent permanent implantation risks, therefore can act as local biotherapeutic platforms. We have developed a novel biodegradable, biomimetic stent composed of polydioxanone with a hydrogel coating and oriented, TGF-(31-loaded nanofiber membrane. It provides up to 6.92 N of radial support force and maintains integrity for 30 days. Employing microsol oriented electrospinning technology, TGF-(31-loaded nanofibers are applied to the stent's surface, not only occluding the EF but also creating a directional matrix for stem cell migration and tissue repair. Additionally, GelMA laden with autologous BMSCs encapsulates the PLGA nanofibers, with BMSCs showing oriented growth and differentiation into myoblasts upon TGF-(31 stimulation. In a rabbit EF model, this biomimetic esophageal stent significantly lowered fistula incidence. Esophagography and histopathological assessments revealed complete EF occlusion in 78 % of subjects. These findings suggest that our biomimetic esophageal stent not only supports and seals the esophagus but also promotes self-repair and tissue regeneration, advancing the application of biodegradable stents for EF treatment.","Engineering, Biomedical",Degradable biomimetic stent with hydrogel and directional TGF-loaded nano-fiber membrane for the treatment of esophageal fistula,,[]

Effective wound healing requires precise coordination of cellular activities both temporally and spatially. However, this synchronization is often overlooked in traditional treatments, making optimal healing difficult to achieve. In this study, we introduce Temporal-Spatial Hierarchical Immunomodulating Dressing (T-shield), a programmable wound dressing that combines 3D printing technology with controlled drug release. T-shield is designed to mimic the skin's multilayer structure and deliver cell modulators at specific times, simulating the natural stages of wound healing. By integrating these modulators within the dressing's layers and allowing for controlled degradation, T-shield ensures that the release of cell modulators aligns with healing process. Importantly, T-shield promotes the transition from the pro-healing phase to the pro-remodeling phase by modulating the shift from the M2a to the M2c macrophage sub-phenotype. Our results show that this strategy not only accelerates wound closure but also significantly improves the quality of healing. Wounds treated with Tshield displayed increased mechanical strength, more mature tissue structures, and enhanced functional properties-features often neglected by conventional therapies. Therefore, T-shield represents a promising approach to improving complex wound healing and highlights the importance of designing materials that align with physiological processes to optimize therapeutic outcomes.","Engineering, Biomedical",Temporal-spatial hierarchical immunomodulating dressing promotes high-quality wound healing through M2 macrophage balancing,,[]

Current immunosuppressive regimens have limitations, such as systemic administration, toxicity, and inefficient inhibition of B cells, macrophages, and natural killer (NK) cells. Targeted immunosuppressant delivery via nanomaterials is a promising approach for sustained release within allografts, significantly enhancing drug efficiency. Manganese dioxide (MnO2) possesses the characteristics of chemotaxis towards inflammatory sites, scavenging ROS, and facilitating drug transport.

By integrating microfiber fragments into an agarose-hyaluronan hydrogel, fine-tuning of its viscosity range (10-1000 mPa & lowast;s), and thus the precise control of the extruded strands' diameter (0.3-1.4 mm) was achieved. While remaining strong shear-thinning behavior (n-value 0.6), E-modulus and yield stress were decreased in fiber-filled hydrogel, hinting at an interaction of agarose polymer chains with microfibers. Remarkably, the orientation of collagen microfibers could be directed either parallel or orthogonal to the printing path. This allows the biofabrication of hydrogel structures with adjustable domains of defined anisotropy. Finally, the fibers showed excellent biofunctionality both in 2D and 3D. Besides a high degree of alignment of individual cells along the microfiber axis (>80 % of cells), hMSCs built a dense, branched network in 3D. Moreover, PC12 and C2C12 were successfully differentiated in 2D and 3D. Specifically, neurite length was higher on smaller fiber diameters, even spanning non-adjacent clusters. Elongated, multi-nuclei myotubes were formed, indicating C2C12 differentiation. In summary, the work demonstrates the great potential of 3D-bioprinting in cross-scale organization of fragmented collagen microfibers.","Engineering, Biomedical",Cell-instructive microfibers enable programmable alignment of bioprinted hMSC,,[]

This attribute is particularly promising for regenerative strategies to treat central nervous system injury, which is a complex system that requires combinatorial approaches to address different mechanisms. Here, a small molecule inhibitor of transforming growth factor (3 (TGF-(3) signaling, sb431542, and repulsive guidance molecule A (RGMa) antagonist peptide are conjugated to the same hyaluronan-based nanocarrier to simultaneously address multiple aspects of the injury microenvironment. The modified hyaluronan is paired with a thermo-responsive polymeric hydrogel, poloxamer 407, to create an injectable delivery system. Synthesis, characterization, and validation of the injectable platform demonstrates mechanical properties on par with previous scaffolds used in the central nervous system, physiologically relevant release rates of cargo, and the ability to modulate cellular function in a three-dimensional in vitro model. Proof of concept studies in a cervical-level hemisection spinal cord injury animal model indicate increased infiltration of both host axons and astrocytes within the lesion following delivery of the hydrogel. Additionally, tracing of rubrospinal and reticularmotor tracts across the site of injury eight weeks post-injury suggests improvements in connectivity.

For the design of implants for cartilage repair after injury or disease, it is key to thoroughly understand the unique mechanical properties of the native tissue. Here, we use multimodal mechanical testing combined with poro-viscoelastic modeling, finite element simulations, and histology to characterize the region-specific macroscopic large-strain mechanical properties of healthy and osteoarthritic human articular cartilage as well as their relation to the underlying microanatomy. We individually characterize tissue from medial and lateral sides, respectively, of the human femoral condyle and tibial plateau. Our results show that there are no significant differences between the medial and lateral sides, but tissue from the tibial plateau is slightly softer than tissue from the femoral condyle. Osteoarthritis leads to a significantly softened mechanical response, which correlates with corresponding microstructural changes. Through the presented combination of experiments and poro-viscoelastic material parameter identification for healthy and osteoarthritic cartilage, we confirm a reduction in stiffness and an increase in permeability due to the disease. The parameters can be valuable for future finite element simulations of the knee joint The presented results will help guide the design of implants that are able to restore cartilage structure and function, bridging biomechanics and regenerative medicine for osteoarthritis treatment.","Engineering, Biomedical",Poro-viscoelastic mechanical characterization of healthy and osteoarthritic human articular cartilage,,[]

ZCESM@mem specifically targeted to tumors via the tumor biotaxis of macrophage membranes coating, and subsequently achieved endogenous H2S-triggered in situ PTT with the generation of photothermal agent copper sulfide in special colon cancer microenvironment, resulting in direct hyperthermia ablation. Moreover, the degraded nanoplatform in acidic microenvironment released the copper ionophores elesclomol to accelerate the transport and accumulation of copper ions at mitochondria for inducing the PTT-promoted cuproptosis. The combined cuproptosis and PTT induced immunogenic cell death, activated the robust immune response and reprogrammed the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, demonstrating potent efficacy in inhibiting tumor proliferation and recurrence.

This study develops radioresistant NSCLC models, revealing that Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine (SPARC) as a crucial modulator of this resistance, through the inhibition of ferroptosis. To address this radio-resistance, we propose a novel ferroptosis-oriented radiosensitization strategy specifically designed to enhance radiotherapy effectiveness in radioresistant NSCLC. Our approach utilized engineered radiosensitizers to facilitate enhanced X-ray energy deposition, which significantly amplified radiation-induced lipid peroxidation while specifically targeting and degrading SPARC proteins. This dual mechanism works by elevating PTGS2 levels induced by radiation, thereby intensifying lipid peroxidation, while concurrently inhibiting the upregulation of adaptive ferroptosis-suppressing GPX4 and SLC7A11. Consequently, this strategy effectively reverses the pro-oxidant intracellular environment characteristic of radiotherapy resistance. By promoting ferroptosis and reestablishing cellular sensitivity to radiation, these radiosensitizers significantly enhance the response of cancer cells to radiotherapy. Our findings underscore the potential of integrating ferroptosis targeting with radio-sensitization as an efficient strategy to enhance antitumor efficacy of radiotherapy, offering a promising avenue to overcome radioresistance in clinical settings.","Engineering, Biomedical",Engineering ferroptosis radiosensitizer for SPARC-targeted degradation: A strategy to reverse radioresistant non-small cell lung cancer,,[]

Among the various strategies used to recreate the in vivo environment for cardiac tissues, mechanical stress has been widely studied for its diverse effects. However, the effects of cellular structure and mechanical loading on the function of scaffold-free tissues remain unclear. Scaffold-free cardiac tissues were fabricated by layering hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes onto human cardiac fibroblasts in temperature-responsive culture dishes. These tissues were harvested and cultured under fixed tissue lengths (representing the degree of shrinkage) and afterloads (resistance against contraction) in a newly designed culture and measurement device capable of measuring the tensional force under various tissue lengths and afterloads. The contractile force, tissue stiffness, morphology, and gene expression were evaluated. Double-layered cells formed in a ring shape were mounted onto the device in a bundle shape, enabling the measurement of contractile forces generated by spontaneous beating. Additionally, increased contractile force was observed in response to both stretching and beta-adrenergic stimulation. The contractile force was influenced by the degree of shrinkage. Tissues set at shorter lengths (greater shrinkage) exhibited significantly reduced force and did not recover by day 7. Additionally, tissues cultured under higher afterloads displayed significantly increased contractile forces and stiffness. Our findings demonstrate that both the initial shrinkage and afterload magnitude critically influence the mechanical function of scaffold-free cardiac tissues.

Here, we developed a universal one-step method to synthesize AA-based NPs. We then constructed L-Arginine (L-Arg)/calcium phosphate (CaP) NPs to enhance cancer therapy through synergistic calcium overload to induce apoptosis and immunogenic cell death. The engineered L-Arg/CaP NPs rapidly degraded and released a large amount of exogenous calcium ions (Ca2+) in the acidic tumor microenvironment (TME). Notably, L-Arg-derived NO synergistically enhanced calcium overload through two distinct mechanisms: (1) induction of S-nitrosylation of the ryanodine receptor (RyR) on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to facilitate endogenous Ca2+ release, and (2) significant downregulation of plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) expression to inhibit Ca2+ efflux. This unique three-level regulatory mechanism involving external Ca2+ supply, internal Ca2+ release, and efflux inhibition created a cascading amplification of intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Importantly, it overcame the limitations of tumor cell stress adaptation in conventional single-ion therapy, thereby establishing a new therapeutic paradigm. In vitro and in vivo studies confirmed that L-Arg/CaP NPs induce tumor suppression with excellent biosafety, indicating the potential for an innovative strategy integrating calcium overload and gas therapy for cancer treatment.","Engineering, Biomedical",Regulating cell stress responses by nitric oxide to enhance calcium overload-mediated tumor therapy,,[]

Our study elucidates the critical role of surgery in exacerbating immunosuppression, thereby contributing to the high postsurgical recurrence rate observed in high-propensity LNMTs. To address this issue, we developed an inflammation-immunomodulatory hydrogel/ nano-immunostimulant composite system (PLA-bioMnOx Gel) for durable postsurgical adjuvant treatment of high-propensity LNMTs. Upon implantation at the surgical site, the poly(alpha-lipoic acid) hydrogel (PLA Gel) effectively alleviates surgery-induced postsurgical local acute inflammation (PLAI), restoring the exacerbated immunosuppressive state to a pre-surgical mild immunosuppressive condition, especially within metastatic lymph nodes (LNs). Simultaneously, bioMnOx nano-immunostimulants released from the PLA hydrogel specifically activate immune responses in metastatic LNs, further elevating immune levels beyond baseline. Our findings clearly demonstrate that PLA-bioMnOx Gel can durably prevent postsurgical recurrence of lymph nodemetastatic melanoma (LNMM) and lymph node-metastatic breast cancer (LNMBC), highlighting its potential in mitigating surgery-exacerbated immunosuppression and thereby enhancing therapeutic outcomes for highpropensity LNMTs.","Engineering, Biomedical",Hydrogel/nano-immunostimulant composite mitigates surgery-exacerbated immunosuppression for durable postsurgical adjuvant treatment of high-propensity lymph node-metastatic tumors,,[]

Unfortunately, MEAs tend to fail over chronic time points, limiting their clinical utility. Chronic failure has largely been attributed to the brain's neuroinflammatory response. Until recently, most of what was understood about the neuroinflammatory response to MEAs was learned through immunohistochemical analysis of small numbers of proteins. More recently, gene expression studies have sequenced thousands of mRNA molecules that contribute to neuroinflammation, but few studies have performed large-scale proteomic analyses. To expand the knowledge of molecular mechanisms involved, we have previously investigated the activity of 62 proteins within 180 mu m of the MEA implant site using a spatial proteomic platform. In the present study, we are the first to apply large-scale genomics and proteomics to MEAs, as we evaluate changes in both the whole protein-encoding mouse transcriptome and our 62-protein proteomic panel. We further examine the spatial distribution of the neuroinflammatory response within three distinct domains adjacent to the MEA: 0-90 mu m, 90-180 mu m, and 180-270 mu m from the implant site. Our analysis directly compares the gene and protein expression and highlights the need for segmentation based on proximal distance from the implant site. We also identify key pathways associated with immune cell activation, neurodegeneration, and metabolism that likely contribute to MEA failure and could be targeted to improve MEA performance in future studies.","Engineering, Biomedical",Multi-omic spatially resolved analysis of the neuroinflammatory response to intracortical microelectrode arrays,,[]

The byproducts that are released from the scaffold in the implantation site as a result of its degradation may lead to the failure of the treatment. Their recognition by the immune cells as foreign bodies will lead to inflammation, which may result in the further release of degradative enzymes, as well as the oxidation, phagocytosis or encapsulation of the engineeredbiomaterial. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have been described to play a role in the direct recognition of scaffolds. However, their implication regarding the degradation-derived products of the latter has not been established, yet. Moreover, the impact of the chemical composition and morphology of the scaffolds on this interaction remains unknown. Herein, polycaprolactone (PCL)-hyaluronic acid (HA)-based electrospun scaffolds with randomly or aligned distributed fibers were degraded, the resulting products were collected and the recognition of the latter by TLRs was assessed by means of TLR reporter cells. Our results demonstrated that the degradation-derived products are capable of triggering TLRs, however, their triggering patterns differ from those of the original scaffolds. While scaffolds were mainly recognised by TLR 4, their degradation-derived products additionally triggered TLR 2/1. Moreover, this interaction changes over time and the alignment of the fibers appears to prevent the production of TLR triggering structures.

In such cases, the mixed-mode interface properties are of interest in predicting the ultimate moment of failure, however, their characterization can be laborious. This paper shows that the influence of mode mixity is insignificant with respect to interface adhesion variability, even for interfaces created under laboratory conditions. This result is obtained from miniature mixed-mode bending tests on bonded dental assemblies with varying mode mixity. In situ microscopy images were used, in combination with digital image correlation, to measure the crack propagation, which plays a critical part in computing the interface toughness. Next, a full uncertainty analysis of all error sources provides an upper bound for the expected variability. In contrast, the influence of mode mixity was much smaller than the measured interface toughness variability leading to the conclusion that the actual interface has a spread in toughness which is likely due to surface roughness and chemical variations along the adhesion surface, instead of due to mode mixity. This interface variability is shown to be much larger than the influence of mode mixity, if present at all. Consequently, in the short term, mode mixity analyses have little impact in the understanding of these interfaces, allowing more attention to be given to the source of the interface variability.","Engineering, Biomedical",Relevance of mode mixity when contrasted with adhesion variability in dental restorations,,[]

However, their inherent immunosuppressive microenvironment and the systemic distribution of conventional therapies often limit antitumor efficacy and increase off-target toxicity. LN-targeted nanomedicines offer a promising strategy to overcome these limitations by enhancing antigen presentation, activating T cells within LNs, and reversing immunosuppression, while minimizing systemic exposure. Key strategies for LN targeting include: (1) passive targeting, where nanoparticle size, charge, and deformability are optimized to favor lymphatic uptake and LN accumulation; (2) active targeting, leveraging ligand-receptor interactions to selectively engage LN-resident immune cells or lymphatic structures; and (3) controlled drug release, enabling sustained and localized delivery to potentiate immunomodulatory effects.

,0,2026-03-01,BIOMATERIALS,"Lymph nodes are highly specialized immune organs that orchestrate the adaptive immune response. In the lymph nodes, naive B and T lymphocytes encounter cognate antigens, sparking their activation and response to foreign substances. Lymph nodes grow in response to an immune challenge, at least in part to accommodate increased numbers of infiltrating and proliferating B and T lymphocytes. This behavior is supported by a robust three-dimensional network of extracellular matrix (ECM) fibers and fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs). ECM fibers and FRCs work synergistically to alternate stretching and contractile forces between them allowing the lymph node to maintain structural integrity during rapid tissue reconstruction. These changes ultimately alter the material properties of the lymph node, which can impact cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation. Recent work has investigated the physiological implications of the changing lymph node microenvironment; however, the biophysical properties of the lymph nodes during these changes remain largely unexplored. Here, we use multiple particle tracking microrheology (MPT), a minimally invasive nanoparticle-based technique to investigate the biophysical properties (elastic/loss moduli, microviscosity, pore size) lymph nodes post inflammatory stimulus. Our results highlight mechanical changes both during the initial phases of the acute inflammatory response and upon resolution of inflammation, a topic that is relatively understudied. We show that B and T cell rich areas exhibit comparable changes in biomechanical properties time, suggesting that they restructure in a similar fashion during acute inflammation.
Additionally, for the first time, we show that biological sex modulates lymph node biomechanics in acute inflammation: Lymph nodes from female mice showed similar to 20-fold increase in elastic and loss moduli at peak inflammation, while lymph nodes from male mice had a similar to 5-fold decrease in both moduli. Additionally, lymph nodes from female mice appeared to permanently remodel during the resolution of acute inflammation resulting in the maintenance of an overall higher elastic loss modulus, while lymph nodes from male mice returned to the biomechanics of untreated lymph nodes. We also found that at least some of the changes biomechanical properties were correlated with changes in ECM materials in the lymph nodes, suggesting a structure-function relationship. Overall, our studies provide key insights into how biomechanical properties in lymph nodes are altered during inflammation, a previously unstudied area, and lay the foundation structure-function relationships involved in immune response.

Subsequently, high levels of ROS in tumor cells disrupt the structure of ROS-responsive therapeutic agents, switching on the chemotherapeutic drug gemcitabine release and further stimulating immune response. Remarkably, laser irradiation of multiple short-duration induces a stronger immune response than that of single long-duration, thus achieving superior treatment outcomes.

However, their unpredictable failure remains a major concern in clinical practice. In this study, acoustic emission (AE) monitoring is used to assess tool wear and detect earlystage damage in real-time. By segmenting the AE frequency spectrum into four bands corresponding to the sensor's sensitivity range (195-742 kHz), high- and low-frequency acoustic energy indicators are defined. The ratio of high-to low-frequency acoustic energy-termed AEDI-is proposed as a damage indicator associated with the initiation and propagation of microcracks. Its evolution during sequential blocks of use is analyzed for about ten instruments. In parallel, the number of acoustic events and the maximum penetration force are recorded and analyzed. The analysis reveals mechanical and acoustic instabilities that can inform the development of early damage detection criteria. Two predictive approaches are proposed: one based on the cumulative high-frequency AE energy (an energy threshold criterion), and another based on the progressive amplitude and recurrence of mechanical and acoustic instabilities (an incremental criterion). The cumulative AEDI-based criterion considers the total energy of high-frequency signals exceeding a defined threshold, and generally predicts damage later, after an average of 5.81 blocks (SD = 0.92). In contrast, the incremental criterion, which is based on changes in maximum force drop and AEDI increases observed at the end of each block, provides earlier warnings, with an average of 3.75 blocks (SD = 1.16).

However, the therapeutic application of CCR5 antagonists in TBI is impeded by the delivery barriers presented by the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and their limited neuron-targeting efficacy. In this study, we introduce a novel nasal-to-brain delivery nanoplatform designed to facilitate the efficient brain delivery of DAPTA, a peptide antagonist of CCR5, aiming to inhibit CCR5 signaling and improving cognitive function following TBI.

The influence of Nb2O5 doping on the phase composition, microstructure, mechanical properties, and hydrothermal aging behavior of the ceramics was investigated. All ceramic pastes showed similar rheological behavior, and no significant difference were observed in shrinkage during sintering. X-ray diffraction revealed an increase in monoclinic phase content with increasing Nb2O5 doping (from 1.03 wt% to 37.60 wt% m-ZrO2). SEM analysis showed grain growth from 0.433 to 0.558 mu m with increasing dopant content. Mechanical testing revealed that low Nb2O5 doping (0.3 wt%) significantly improved fracture toughness (from 4.36 to 7.52 MPa m1/2), while higher doping levels led to a decline in flexural strength (from 999.68 to 380.23 MPa) and hardness (from 12.71 to 9.51 GPa). Accelerated aging tests (134 degrees C/0.2 MPa, for up to 50 h) demonstrated that Nb2O5 addition promoted t -> m transformation, increasing monoclinic content and surface roughness, ultimately reduced aging stability.

In this study, we developed a manganese-based nanoplatform, termed MnOxChP, which combines peroxidase-, catalase-, glutathione oxidase-, and NADPH oxidase-like nanozyme activities with cholesterol oxidase (ChOx) to enhance STING activation for effective cancer immunotherapy by modulating cholesterol metabolism and hypoxia. ChOx catalyzes the oxidation of cholesterol and O2 into H2O2, depleting cholesterol, which disrupts lipid rafts domains, inhibits DNA damage repair, and increases membrane fluidity. This process amplifies the cytosolic DNA pool, induced by lethal center dot OH from the Fenton-like reaction, thereby strengthening STING activation mediated by Mn2+. Additionally, the multiple enzyme-like activities of MnOx overcome the tumor's antioxidant defense system and alleviate hypoxia, further enhancing center dot OH-induced lethality and cholesterol oxidation. Cholesterol depletion also inhibits the PD-1/ PD-L1 axis, mitigating CD8+ T cells exhaustion. The MnOxChP nanoplatform induces potent immunogenic cell death, demonstrating significant immunotherapeutic efficacy in both abscopal and metastasis mouse models. This strategy amplifies STING activation and expands the potential of cholesterol metabolism modulation-based immunotherapy.","Engineering, Biomedical",A multifunctional manganese-based nanozyme platform for synergistic hypoxia alleviation and cholesterol depletion to potentiate STING-mediated cancer immunotherapy,,[]

While in vitro experiments have revealed a role for each of these factors in individually promoting malignant behavior, their combined effects remain unclear. Here, we engineered alginate-collagen hydrogels with independently tunable stiffness, stress relaxation, and collagen density to dissect how the complex ECM environment regulates cancer cell phenotype. We show that high stiffness, fast stress relaxation, and high collagen density led to changes in cell morphology, marked by decreased roundness, and promoted spheroid invasion in both breast cancer and non-transformed mammary epithelial cells. Single cell migration speed and displacement were greatest in matrices of high stiffness, low collagen density, and slow stress relaxation. RNA-seq and Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (CUT&Tag)-seq revealed that high stiffness and fast stress relaxing groups were enriched for Sp1 target gene expression as well as increased Sp1 binding at genomic loci. Notably, analysis of publicly available claudin-low breast cancer data showed that high expression of the Sp1-regulated genes in fast stress relaxing groups was correlated with significantly reduced patient survival. Mechanistically, we found that phosphorylated Sp1 (T453) exhibited increased nuclear localization in matrices with high stiffness and fast stress relaxation. Furthermore, Sp1 phosphorylation was regulated by PI3K and ERK1/2 activity, as well as actomyosin contractility. Our tunable hydrogel platform reveals that multiple tumor-mimicking cues within complex viscoelastic microenvironments reinforce malignant traits, with Sp1 acting as a mechanoresponsive transcription factor that transduces these signals.","Engineering, Biomedical",Sp1 mechanotransduction regulates breast cancer cell invasion in engineered viscoelastic extracellular matrices,,[]

Currently, basement membrane extracts (BME or Matrigel) dominate the in vitro culture of PTO models, although BME hydrogels suffer from batch-to-batch variability, possible contamination of murine host cells, and non-tunable mechanical properties. Here, we design and prepare fully synthetic thermoreversible nanofibrillar hydrogels (TNHs) for the growth and enzyme-free release of ovarian PTOs. PTOs cultured in TNHs exhibit morphological, histological, and gene expression similarities to organoids grown in Matrigel and their corresponding tumor tissues. In addition, the on-demand release of PTOs without loss of cell viability and organoid integrity is achieved upon cooling. The released PTOs show a strong tumorigenic ability by xenografts of PTOs in mice.

,0,2026-02-01,BIOMATERIALS,"Myelination by oligodendrocytes (OLs) is critical for central nervous system (CNS) function. It facilitates rapid electrical conduction and supports neuronal metabolism. Unfortunately, spinal cord injury (SCI) disrupts this process by causing OL loss and axonal demyelination. Consequently, profound functional deficits are frequently observed. Although myelination is important, the role of remyelination remains a topic of debate. Numerous studies strongly support the role of remyelination in restoring function after chemically induced demyelination. However, reducing OL-mediated remyelination does not appear to impede functional recovery in the contusion SCI model. Importantly, although several studies have shown that promoting remyelination can aid functional recovery, its specific contribution in severe injuries, such as complete transection SCI remains less well understood. This study tackles this question by deploying a bio-mimicking drug delivery scaffold to enhance remyelination in a severe complete transection SCI model in mice. Extending our prior work, we now demonstrate that our fiber-hydrogel scaffold loaded with miR-219/miR-338 could effectively promote the rate and extent of oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation into mature OLs as compared to non-functional microRNA (Neg miR) treatment after SCI. Notably, the proportion of myelinated axons within these scaffolds was significantly greater with miR-219/miR-338 treatment (p < 0.001 vs. Neg miR). Furthermore, treatment with miR-219/miR-338 significantly improved sensory and locomotor recovery of injured mice starting 4 weeks post-treatment, and kinematic analysis further demonstrated enhanced motor coordination and gait patterns. Collectively, these findings suggest that enhanced OL remyelination improves functional recovery even in a more challenging complete transection SCI paradigm when mice were treated with fiber-hydrogel scaffolds loaded with miR-219/miR-338.","Engineering, Biomedical",Sustained MicroRNA delivery enhanced remyelination and functional recovery after spinal cord injury,,[]

In this study, a multifunctional therapeutic implant activating local tumor-eating macrophages and promote bone regeneration in stages was developed by assembling a co-delivery system that enriched CSF-1R inhibitors within the internal porous structure and immobilizes anti-SIRP alpha on the surface based on boron-nitrogen coordination bonds onto an aldehyde-rich 3D printed calcium phosphate scaffold using dynamic covalent bonds. The phenylboric acid-modified mesoporous silica nanoparticle served as an efficient drug carrier for the enrichment of CSF-1R inhibitor and stable binding of antibodies while preserving their bioactivity. The co-delivery system was assembled onto the calcium phosphate scaffold through loading via the HBC network, enabling sustained release in the targeted treatment area. This efficiently blocked the MCSF/CSF-1R and CD47/SIPR alpha signaling interactions between tumor cells and macrophages, thereby inhibiting M2 polarization of macrophages while preserving their phagocytic activity and inhibiting tumor recurrence. Afterward, gradual disintegration of the assembled structure exposed the calcium phosphate and silicon-based core, which promoted bone tissue repair. In summary, the stably assembled therapeutic scaffold with a co-delivery system targeting the regulation of tumor-eating macrophages in situ provides a new strategy for the suppression of tumor immune escape and recurrence following surgery.","Engineering, Biomedical",Activation of bone tumor-eating macrophages via assembling and co-delivering 3D printed scaffold,,[]

It initiates a series of harmful physiological responses, such as increased intracranial pressure, cerebral edema, and neuroinflammation. Pyroptosis, a form of cell death dependent on caspase-1, plays a crucial role in the inflammatory processes following SAH. Recent research indicated that the inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome is regarded as a promising therapeutic strategy for mitigating inflammatory responses. Bindarit, a beta-blocker with anti-inflammatory properties, has demonstrated potential in mitigating NLRP3mediated pyroptosis. Nevertheless, its clinical application is limited by its short half-life and inadequate penetration of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). To address these limitations, a novel pH-responsive erythrocyte membrane-biomimetic guanidino-based covalent organic framework (COF) nanocarrier, designated as B@COFDT-R, has been developed to encapsulate bindarit. This nanocarrier is specifically engineered to enhance drug delivery across the BBB and target the NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD axis, thereby inhibiting neuronal pyroptosis in vitro and vivo. The development of B@COFDT-R constitutes a substantial advancement in the treatment of SAH. Through the enhancement of drug delivery mechanisms and the targeted modulation of critical inflammatory pathways, this nanocarrier holds the potential to significantly improve therapeutic outcomes for patients suffering from SAH.","Engineering, Biomedical",A pH-responsive guanidino-based covalent organic framework nanodrugs for enhanced neuroprotection against subarachnoid hemorrhage by targeting NLRP3 inflammasome,,[]

However, their clinical utility is frequently limited by poor oral bioavailability and insufficient accumulation at target sites. In this study, we fabricated a multifunctional nanoplatform for H. pylori-targeted therapy developed through a computationally guided design strategy. Advanced computational methods-including density functional theory (DFT) calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations-were employed to identify tanshinone I (Tan_I) as an optimal herbal candidate for encapsulation within a thiolated fucoidan-polydopamine (PDA-FuSH) nanocarrier. The resulting nanoplatform (T@PDA-FuSH) demonstrated exceptional stability, high drug-loading efficiency, and distinct gastric mucoadhesive properties, attributable to its strong binding affinity for gastric mucin MUC5AC. Furthermore, T@PDA-FuSH exhibited robust bactericidal activity against both standard H. pylori strains and drug-resistant clinical isolates. In vivo evaluation using a H. pylori infected murine model revealed that T@PDA-FuSH effectively reduced H. pylori burden, alleviated inflammatory responses, and promoted the restoration of gastric mucosal integrity. Importantly, this treatment modality preserved the homeostasis of the gastric microbiota, notably enhancing the abundance of beneficial probiotics such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. Overall, our computationally guided approach provides a novel and promising platform for optimizing the oral delivery of herbal bioactives, significantly enhancing their therapeutic efficacy against H. pylori infection.","Engineering, Biomedical",Computationally-guided multifunctional nanoplatform for enhanced oral delivery and targeted therapy of Helicobacter pylori using herbal bioactives,,[]

While ultrasound (US)-enhanced catalytic therapy can trigger pyroptosis through increased oxidative stress, tumor cells frequently circumvent this process via intrinsic resistance mechanisms. Herein, ferrous fluoride (FeF2) nanoinitiators were developed to promote US-enhanced catalytic activity via stemness reprogramming to amplify pyroptosis-driven antitumor immunity. The incorporation of F significantly reduced the energy barrier during FeF2-mediated H2O2 catalysis, thereby boosting ROS generation. US irradiation further potentiated this catalytic process, leading to rapid ROS accumulation. Notably, F was found to suppress Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in cancer cells by upregulating the endogenous inhibitor DKK1. This stemness attenuation mechanism enhanced tumor cell susceptibility to oxidative stress, consequently promoting pyroptosis. The resulting immunogenic cascade triggered dendritic cell (DC) maturation and increased cytotoxic T-cell infiltration, effectively overcoming immunosuppression and suppressing tumor growth. In bilateral tumor models, synergistic effects with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy elicited robust systemic immune responses, significantly enhancing therapeutic outcomes. This innovative approach bridges the therapeutic gap through synchronized stemness reprogramming and pyroptosis induction, establishing a paradigm for precision-engineered nanoinitiators in advanced catalytic immunotherapy.","Engineering, Biomedical",Ferrous fluoride nanoinitiators reprogram tumor stemness to empower ultrasound-augmented pyroptosis for potent catalytic immunotherapy,,[]

Biomaterial therapies have aimed to passively reinforce the infarcted left ventricle (LV), but their therapeutic impact remains limited as they fail to directly address the loss of functional CMs. In this work, we employed a simulation-guided workflow to design an optimized biomaterial support that can be combined with contractile CMs for implantation after MI. A finite element model (FEM) of the LV post-MI was developed and showed longitudinal reinforcement and active contractility improves ejection fraction (EF) post-MI (+3.39 % and +14.97 %, respectively). To this end, we developed a coordinated remuscularizationreinforcement therapy using engineered human myocardium (EHM) composed of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived CMs (hiPSC-CMs) integrated with a highly aligned electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffold. Remuscularization (EHM-only), reinforcement (PCL-only) and its coordinated therapy (PCL-EHM) were evaluated in a rat model of MI. We report successful engraftment of the implants onto the heart with significant maturation of hiPSC-CMs after four weeks in vivo (similar to 7-fold increase of cTnT area and similar to 2-fold increase MLC2v area compared to in vitro cultured controls). Using 4D ultrasound (US), we quantified 3D regional strains and found that the benefits of PCL reinforcement on maintaining LV structure and function were additive with remuscularization by EHM. This additive effect was reflected inimproved regional strain after injury when PCL and EHM were delivered as a composite therapy.

While research has progressed on the chondrogenic differentiation and regenerative medicine applications of cartilage derived from human iPSC-derived MSCs via a NCCs lineage (iNC), studies on smooth muscle, a critical tracheal component alongside cartilage, remain limited. In this study, we aimed to establish a method for generating airway smooth muscle tissue constructs using human iNCMSCs, assess their contractile function, and evaluate their regenerative potential in tracheal cartilage defects. iNCMSCs were cultured for 28 d in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with fetal bovine serum (FBS), with one group receiving transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF beta 1, DMEM-TGF beta 1 group) and the other group without TGF beta 1 (DMEM group). SMCs markers was assessed using immunofluorescence staining. The tissue constructs were bio-3D printed using spheroids from the DMEM-TGF beta 1 group and transplanted as smooth muscle patches into full-thickness defects in the rats' tracheas. The DMEM-TGF beta 1 group showed strong expression of SMCs markers such as alpha-smooth muscle actin, calponin, and myosin heavy chain. After 28 d post-transplant, histological evaluation confirmed graft engraftment, adequate blood flow, and epithelial layer extensions from the recipient tissues, along with well-maintained tracheal structures.

However, vascular injury and implant stimulation trigger a feedback loop between coagulation and inflammation, impairing endothelial cell (EC) function, which is critical for long-term success in atherosclerotic vessels. Here, we designed a self-adaptive covalent coating stent that integrates thrombin-responsive release of apixaban as a coagulation modulator and an antioxidant polyphenol as an anti-inflammatory. This pathologic microenvironment-responsive coating regulates coagulation-inflammation loop post-implantation. The nanogels within the coating dynamically response to thrombin, the upstream initiator of coagulation-inflammation, to release apixaban in high thrombotic risk conditions while retaining it in low-risk states. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), functioning as a cross-linker and the ROS scavagener, detaches in response to oxidative stress. As such, the coating enables blockade of coagulation-inflammation loop, synergistically protects ECs from inflammatory damage, promotes endothelial regeneration, and inhibits endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), efficiently modulating the inflammatory microenvironment via localized and coordinated regulation of coagulation-inflammation loop. Furthermore, the implantation in an atherosclerotic rabbit model demonstrated that the coating inhibits plaque deterioration linked to inflammation and endothelial damage.

Pin motion was applied either longitudinal or transverse to the circumferential fibers of the meniscal tissue. We measured the effect of wear testing on meniscal volume loss, compressive mechanical properties, fiber fraying, and superficial layer thickness. A three-fold increase in loading magnitude resulted in a 36% increase in volume loss and a significant increase in fiber fraying. Multidirectional motion resulted in 31% greater volume loss than unidirectional motion, however, this change was not significant. Transverse specimens exhibited 1.8x greater volume loss than longitudinal specimens. Multiple regression revealed that meniscal tissue was more resistant to wear when it had higher initial tissue stiffness and greater initial stress relaxation.

Although, decellularized aortic valves (DAVs) are widely regarded as a scaffold in the construction of TEHV, the poor hemocompatibility and adverse immune responses make DAV scaffolds prone to thrombosis and degradation, thus hindering recellularization and in situ regeneration. Our study developed an immune-regulatory strategy involving the use of hydrogel-encapsulated nanoparticles to modify DAV scaffolds. Specifically, folic acid- and hyaluronic acid-modified mesoporous silica nanoparticles (FA-HAMSNs@CY-09) were engineered to deliver NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inhibitor CY-09, thereby targeting macrophages, modulating their polarization and establishing a pro-regenerative immune microenvironment. The reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive hydrogel delivering FA-HAMSNs@CY-09 enabled intelligent nanoparticle release and ROS scavenging. Results demonstrated that the hydrogel-modified DAV scaffold exhibited ROS-responsive release of FA-HA-MSNs@CY-09, which effectively induced macrophage polarization toward the pro-remodeling M2 phenotype. In vitro, the scaffold showed favorable mechanical properties, cytocompatibility, and hemocompatibility. Transcriptome sequencing elucidated the macrophage-reprogramming mechanism of the scaffold. In vivo, the scaffolds promoted significant M2 macrophage infiltration shortly after implantation, facilitating endothelial tissue formation. This resulted in enhanced endothelialization and interstitial cell infiltration under blood flow, without thrombosis or calcification.

The reaction of methacrylic anhydride with 1-RHC yields methacrylate RHC (1-RHCMA), which when combined with PRP, self-assembles into an arrow-shaped MNP, 1-RHCMA-PRP Arrow-MNP (RPAM) via a triple-molding process. The 1-RHCMA-PRP hydrogel demonstrates pro-epithelial, pro-angiogenesis, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial properties in vitro. When applied to rat diabetic wound models, RPAM also regulates collagen alignment and demonstrates robust mechanical properties which can prevent pathological scar formation by stabilizing the wound bed. Transcriptome sequencing further confirms that RPAM promotes excellent healing via pro-keratinization and modulation of immune response. Additionally, RPAM exhibits no toxicity to any organs within the organism, mitigating any immunogenic concerns. Herein, our RPAM dual-derived from PRP and 1-RHCMA can manage wound complications with minimal invasiveness and excellent wound closure, offering significant potential for clinical translation.","Engineering, Biomedical","Triple-molded, reinforced arrowhead microneedle patch of dual human-derived matrix for integrated management of diabetic wounds",,[]

This has induced severe clinical events, such as progressive cognitive impairment and irreversible neurological damage. However, an effective clinical pharmacotherapy is lacking, highlighting the urgent need for a new therapeutic target and development of an effective drug delivery platform. Accordingly, in the present study, we identified that neuronal cuproptosis plays a crucial role in RBI by spatial transcriptomics. Furthermore, we constructed a biomimetic delivery system using mesoporous silica nanoparticle to dual-load UK5099 (cuproptosis inhibitor) and melatonin (neuroinflammation inhibitor), which was followed by the camouflage of targeting macrophage membrane. Through nose-to-brain delivery, this system was found to quickly distribute the in the injured brain to release UK5099 to inhibit neuronal cuproptosis; meanwhile, release melatonin was released to alleviate neuroinflammation by eliminating reactive oxygen species, inhibiting glial overactivation, and downregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, this system considerably improved behavioral functions, decreased brain edema, and increased neuronal survival in RBI mice, which was superior to the single treatment based on either cuproptosis or neuroinflammation. Furthermore, the underlying therapeutic mechanism was preliminarily revealed. The results not only highlight the significance of neuronal cuproptosis in RBI, but also suggest that it is a promising approach in RBI therapy.","Engineering, Biomedical",Targeting neuronal cuproptosis and neuroinflammation with biomimetic nanoparticle for the therapy of radiotherapy-induced brain injury,,[]

In addition to the negative aesthetic effects, such oral diseases cause increased pain and discomfort during everyday activities and advanced forms of these diseases can ultimately result in tooth loss. This motivates the need for novel therapies aimed at regenerating tissues inside and around the tooth or, in the case of tooth extraction, to promote development of sufficient tissue volume to allow for implant placement. Tissue engineering strategies typically combine three-dimensional biomaterial scaffolds, cells and biologics in order to regenerate or replace damaged or diseased tissues. This review will focus on advances in tissue engineering applications within the oral cavity, with a particular emphasis put on periodontal and endodontic tissue regeneration. To that end, we begin by describing the aetiology and progression of the disease states that cause damage to tissues inside and surrounding the tooth and, furthermore, will describe the procedures that are currently used clinically in the treatment of these conditions. Subsequently, biomaterialbased approaches that can be leveraged to promote regeneration of periodontal and endodontic tissues are explored and, thereafter, the advances made in enhancing the efficacy of these biomaterials through the use of cells and biologics outlined.

In this study, we proposed a novel strategy for precise cancer immunotherapy via synergistic activation of PANoptosis and innate immunity. Specifically, an innovative nano-biocomposite has been developed through the strategic integration of engineered Escherichia coli BL21 (EcBD) with biodegradable ceriummanganese hydroxide nanoparticles (CeMn(OH)x NPs). Within the hypoxic tumor microenvironment, EcBD exhibited targeted aggregation and controllably released a membrane-bound tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (mTRAIL), which induced apoptosis through specific receptor recognition on tumor cells. Concurrently, the CeMn(OH)x NPs underwent tumor microenvironment-responsive degradation, releasing Ce3+ and Mn2+ ions. Ce3+-mediated DNA damage and multi-organelle dysfunction led to inflammatory cascade activation to induce PANoptosis. Moreover, Mn2+ ions could bind to free DNA fragments to activate the cGASSTING pathway. The coordinated PANoptosis and cGAS-STING-mediated immune activation could reverse tumor immunosuppression, effectively suppressing primary tumor progression and metastatic dissemination. This combined bacteria-nanomaterial approach for inducing PANoptosis and stimulating innate immunity offers a promising new direction for precision cancer immunotherapy.","Engineering, Biomedical",A novel nano-biocomposite synergistically activates PANoptosis and cGAS-STING for precise cancer immunotherapy,,[]

Decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) hydrogels are a tissue-derived, injectable biomaterial with intrinsic regenerative capacity. However, dECM hydrogels often exhibit mechanical instability and share the same problems with degradation as existing vocal fold biomaterials. In this work, we developed a composite dECM-alginate hydrogel with bioorthogonal click tetrazine ligation with improved stability, biocompatibility and regenerative capacity. dECM was extracted from two sources: tissue-specific vocal fold mucosa and scalable small intestinal submucosa for comparative analysis. Click dECM hydrogels from both sources were tunable and matched mechanical properties of native human vocal folds. The click dECM hydrogels showed capacity to resist contraction and modulate bioactive molecule secretion by fibroblasts, as well as stimulate the initial endothelial cell elongation phase of vasculogenesis. When injected subcutaneously into rats, both gels exhibit a strong initial immune response, followed by integration with the surrounding tissue by day 21.

To address this, we developed mPDA@MSC, a nanosystem consisting of mesoporous polydopamine (mPDA) nanoparticles coated with a mesenchymal stem cell membrane (MSCm), which exhibits ROS-scavenging properties. The mPDA structure significantly enhanced ROS-scavenging and antiinflammatory activities, while the surface-encapsulated MSCm enabled effective blood-brain barrier traversal and targeted the lesion site in the PD brain. Both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that mPDA@MSC exerted anti-Parkinsonian effects through multiple mechanisms, including ROS scavenging, modulation of mitochondrial dysfunction, and promotion of the transition from pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory microglial phenotypes. This resulted in the reversal of dopaminergic neuron damage, inhibition of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) production, and improvement in behavioral deficits and other phenotypes.

Since bone tissues vary in mechanical demands, a reliable predictive model can guide scaffold design before laboratory fabrication, reducing both cost and time for researchers. This study proposes numerical models using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) alongside an experimental study to evaluate PHBV/PCL blends with varying porosities. In this study, 13 PHBV/PCL scaffolds with varying porosities were fabricated and analyzed. Experimental results showed that the properties of PHBV/PCL scaffolds were strongly influenced by polymer ratio and porosity. Pure PCL (20 %) exhibited higher porosity (>20 %) compared to pure PHBV (<8 %). In PCL-based groups, increasing NaCl content (porosity) elevated the contact angle from 74 degrees to 115 degrees, while water uptake rose from <10 % (no NaCl) to similar to 200 %, highlighting PCL's role in enhancing hydrophilicity. More porous samples also showed slower water removal (174 %-1 % over 48 h). Mechanical testing revealed elastic modulus values ranging from 34 to 931 MPa and 6-287 MPa for wet and dried scaffolds, respectively. Importantly, Response Surface Methodology (RSM) demonstrated excellent predictive accuracy (R-2 = 0.93-0.99), confirming its utility as a robust numerical tool for estimating scaffold properties. These findings highlight RSM's potential to accelerate scaffold optimization and support researchers in tailoring PHBV/PCL blends for diverse bone tissue requirements.","Engineering, Biomedical",Developing models to predict mechanical behavior of PCL/PHBV composites for tissue Engineering: A response surface methodology study,,[]
,0,2026-01-01,JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS,"Superelastic NiTi bone staples have become increasingly favoured for internal fixators by surgeons in clinical practice due to their high ability to maintain bone compression. They can adapt dynamically to structural changes and preserve bone alignment. Their insertion is easy, compared to other fixation methods. Due to the severe allergic reactions and cytotoxicity of nickel, Ni-free superelastic biomedical alloys recently benefit from special attention. Through a finite element analysis (FEA), this work firstly compares the mechanical performance of superelastic compressive staples made in NiTi with two recent superelastic metastable beta-Ti alloys: Ti-24Zr-10Nb-2Sn and Ti-22Zr-11Nb-2Sn. The initial staple design is based on a classical protocol. The mechanical performance of the staple is evaluated through its clamping pressure, contact force, contact area with the bone, and minimum compressive strain into the bone. The first comparison concerns the three superelastic staples mentioned above with four different bone properties. For all the bone types, Ti-24Zr-10Nb-2Sn staples clearly outperform NiTi staples, making them a promising substitute for a wide range of bone conditions. The second part of the study aims to investigate the impacts of staple bridge widths and staple leg tapering shapes. Thanks to a parametric study, a staple bridge width of 15 mm is identified as an inflection point in the clamping pressure and maximum bone strain results. Additionally, moderately tapering the staple limbs is found to effectively increase clamping pressure while ensuring assembly safety, which provides valuable design insights, particularly for cases with limited space for staple insertion. This comprehensive study on the mechanical performance of compressive staples by FEA provides guidance for optimizing bone staple design, using Ni-free superelastic alloys and refining staple geometry dimensions.","Engineering, Biomedical",Modelling of mechanical performance by finite element analysis of compressive bone staples made of superelastic NiTi and Ti-Zr-Nb-Sn alloys,,[]

In this study, we introduce two polymer-antibody drug conjugates (pADCs), ISA-P-EPI (U6244-021) and DARA-P-EPI (U6244-031), which contain semitelechelic N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymer-epirubicin (EPI) conjugate attached to CD38-targeting antibodies Isatuximab (ISA) and Daratumumab (DARA). These pADCs enhance therapeutic efficacy by combining the specificity of ISA and DARA with the cytotoxic potency of EPI while preserving antibody function. The EPI is linked to the HPMA polymer backbone via a tetrapeptide spacer cleavable by lysosomal enzymes, enabling drug release upon endocytosis within tumor cells. This design achieves a higher drug-to-antibody ratio than conventional ADCs for safer delivery of drug payload. In vitro studies demonstrate efficient binding, internalization, and cytotoxic efficacy of these pADCs in MM cell lines. Mechanistic investigations revealed significant therapeutic effects, including cell cycle arrest, immunogenic cell death, and preserved antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In addition, pADCs were effective in 5 out of 8 primary samples, with their efficacy closely correlating with CD38 surface expression levels. To enhance therapeutic outcomes, we employed panobinostat to upregulate CD38 expression, which further improved pADC efficacy. In a preclinical NRG mouse model inoculated with MM.1S-luc cells, pADC treatment significantly delayed tumor progression and prolonged survival, with all treated mice remaining alive at the 100-day endpoint. These findings underscore the potential of CD38-targeted pADCs as a novel approach to combining chemotherapy with immunotherapy for MM treatment, warranting further investigation into their optimization and clinical application.","Engineering, Biomedical",CD38-targeted antibody-polymer drug conjugates for enhanced treatment of multiple myeloma,,[]

The aim of the study was to compare gait kinematics and kinetics in joints of the contralateral and ipsilateral side of patients after THA or TKA to controls. Methods: 103 participants (45 THA; 30 TKA; 28 controls) completed three-dimensional instrumented gait analysis. Differences in lower extremity kinematic and kinetic trajectories between each patient group and controls were analyzed using statistical parametric mapping with t-tests (p < 0.05). Findings: Compared to controls, patients after TKA had greater hip flexion and ankle dorsiflexion angles during terminal stance and pre-swing and greater knee adduction during terminal stance and lower ankle dorsiflexion moments on the contralateral side. On the ipsilateral side, patients with TKA had greater sagittal ankle angles during loading response, greater hip angles in terminal stance and lower ankle moments than controls. THA patients had smaller hip adduction angles during loading response and larger knee flexion angles during early stance on the ipsilateral side. Patients after TKA walked slower than controls, whereas patients after THA walked at similar speeds. Interpretation: Differences in kinematic and kinetic patterns compared to controls were not only evident in the operated joint but also in the adjacent and contralateral joints in patients after TKA, but only in the ipsilateral joints in patients after THA. This suggests that 1 year after surgery, patients after THA recover faster in the contralateral joints than patients after TKA.","Engineering, Biomedical",Differences in gait kinematics and kinetics between patients 1 year after total hip or knee arthroplasty and healthy controls,,[]

A promising strategy is to achieve persistent presentation of relevant antigens (Ags) in non-inflamed sites by tolerogenic Ag-presenting cells (APCs) like fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs). FRCs build lymph node (LN) reticula and act as immunomodulatory non-professional APCs. However, their therapeutic potential for Ag-specific immunomodulation for T1D remains unexplored. We engineered 3D FRC-based reticula using freeze-dried macroporous gelatin scaffolds with customizable pore diameters (small: <50 mu m, medium: <200 mu m, large: <300 mu m) to evaluate FRC phenotype and FRC-T cell interactions, leveraging FRCs' ability to build dynamic LN reticula that expand and contract during inflammation. Our scaffolds promoted FRC viability, reticular formation, FRC phenotypic marker expression, and extracellular matrix secretion compared to 2D culture. GFP-Luciferase fusion (GLF)-expressing FRCs subcutaneously implanted in our scaffolds survived for at least 21 days regardless of pore size. Implantation in the vascularized fat pad led to graft rejection by day 14 in pre-diabetic NOD mice but not in immunodeficient NODscid. Our scaffolds outperformed clinically-used biologic gels, demonstrated the limitations of the NOD mouse model in longitudinal imaging of GLF(+) cell survival, and validated our scaffold-based FRC delivery approach for future therapeutic applications. Co-culture of T cells in scaffolds with FRCs presenting T1D Ags enabled Ag-specific T cell engagement with reduced cytotoxic and increased anergic and regulatory phenotypes. Our results validate the use of macroporous gelatin scaffolds to enhance FRC phenotypic markers, in vivo survival, and diabetogenic cell immunomodulation in vitro.","Engineering, Biomedical",Engineered macroporous gelatin scaffolds enhance lymph node fibroblastic reticular cell identity and enable diabetogenic T cell immunomodulation,,[]

T-sEVs serve as biomarkers and therapeutic targets owing to their roles in mediating intercellular communication, promoting tumor progression and metastasis, and fostering immunosuppressive microenvironments that hinder immunotherapy. However, when appropriately utilized and their unique properties leveraged, T-sEVs exhibit therapeutic potential. This review explores the potential of T-sEVs as a multifaceted therapeutic option for enhancing cancer immunotherapies. It overviews the emerging research trends and applications of three main therapeutic strategies: eliminating immunosuppressive T-sEVs, utilizing T-EVs as drug carriers with tumor-targeting capabilities, and exploiting T-EVs as antigenic platforms to enhance anticancer immunity.

This dysregulated microenvironment exhibits remarkable chirality, but how the stereochemical specificity governs host immunometabolism networks remains elusive. In this study, we engineered chiral gold nanoparticles (L/D-AuNPs) to modulate immunometabolic interactions, thereby significantly promoting diabetic wound healing. To align with the chiral characteristics of the vimentin intermediate filaments (VIFs), L/D-AuNPs with mirror-symmetric windmill-like configurations were synthesized using a seedmediated growth method. In diabetic murine wounds, L-AuNPs demonstrated superior therapeutic efficacy, enhancing wound healing rate by 29 % compared to the control group. Mechanistic studies revealed that LAuNPs upregulated the expression of the intermediate filaments vimentin, enhancing fibroblast migration. Concomitant mechanotransduction activated the TGF-beta/Slug signaling axis, driving nicotinamide metabolic reprogramming in fibroblasts, which subsequently polarized macrophages toward an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. This immunometabolic crosstalk was further validated by single-cell transcriptomic profiling of diabetic patient skin specimens. Based on this finding, we combined L-AuNPs with exogenous nicotinamide, which further accelerated wound regeneration through a significant synergistic effect.

In this study, we systematically evaluate the roles of PLs within SORT LNPs. Our results demonstrate that PL enrichment enhances cellular transfection efficiency by increasing membrane fusion and endosomal escape. In vivo, we observe that PL-containing SORT LNPs significantly increase protein expression following intramuscular administration in mice, whereas moderate PL inclusion is optimal for intravenous delivery. Cryo-electron microscopy reveals that PL modulation induces distinct morphological rearrangements in LNP structure, which may influence the selective adsorption of plasma proteins, an essential factor in endogenous targeting mechanisms. These findings highlight the fundamental role of PLs in supporting intracellular delivery and guiding organ-specific biodistribution through protein corona formation.

Insulin, a prevalent blood glucose-lowering pharmaceutical agent, has demonstrated the capacity to facilitate diabetic wound healing. Nevertheless, the optimal therapeutic concentration for its direct application at the wound site remains ambiguous. The direct external use of insulin solution is associated with the potential for adverse effects and reduced efficacy. In this article, a dual-network hydrogel (AP/SA gel) is developed for the intelligent delivery of insulin to the wound environment for therapeutic purposes. Phenylboronic acid-modified gelatin (AP) and sodium alginate (SA) were bonded via phenylboronic acid ester bond to enable the hydrogel to deliver insulin in a glucose-responsive manner. The calcium ions were then introduced to chelate with the sodium alginate, thereby rendering the hydrogel less susceptible to hydrolysis and extending the delivery time of the insulin. After determining the optimal concentration of insulin through preliminary experiments, the insulin-loaded hydrogel was administered to full-thickness skin defect model of diabetic mice. The results demonstrated that the hydrogel not only effectively reduced blood glucose levels in the mice but also significantly promoted cell proliferation and angiogenesis at the wound site. These findings suggest that the hydrogel may have the potential to facilitate healing in diabetic wounds.

While global spinal symmetry is often assumed in biomechanical assessments, segmental asymmetries may exist and contribute to conditions such as low back pain (LBP). The present study investigates the multiplanar kinematic behavior and torque asymmetry of the lumbar spine using cadaveric specimens, focusing on identifying segmental asymmetries that may be masked in global motion analysis. A novel experimental setup combining a 6 degrees-of-freedom robotic system with optical metrology was used to apply controlled flexion-extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation to human lumbar spines. The metrology system enabled precise, non-contact tracking of vertebral motion in three dimensions, ensuring accurate quantification of segmental kinematics. Symmetrical motion inputs were applied bilaterally during lateral bending and axial rotation, while torque responses were recorded. Segmental range of motion (ROM) and torque asymmetries were quantified in the coronal and axial planes. Despite symmetrical inputs, torque outputs showed asymmetries exceeding 15 % in several specimens. Segmental ROM asymmetries were observed in most vertebrae, sometimes exceeding 40 %, and could vary across planes without consistent correlation. Notably, some spines exhibited segmental asymmetry despite overall torque symmetry, highlighting the limitations of global assessments. These findings underscore the importance of segment-level analysis in spinal biomechanics. Hidden asymmetries may have clinical implications for diagnosing and treating LBP.

An ultra-lean Mg-0.1Pr alloy with a multiscale microstructure has been developed through casting and extrusion, which showed well-balanced performances that match the commercial Mg-based orthopedic products. Compared to the first clinically approved WE43 magnesium alloy, the complex RE addition (7 wt.%) in WE43 is simplified into one single RE (0.1 wt.%) with its content having a 70-fold reduction in the newly developed alloy, while without impairing mechanical properties (tensile strength: 285.6 MPa). This also leads to a mild degradation rate, a good cell & tissue compatibility and osteogenic capacity both in vitro and in vivo. The simplified Mg-0.1Pr alloy exhibits excellent local and systemic biocompatibility in the femoral condyle of rats during a 16-month long-term follow-up, with this period approximately covering the entire life cycle of the implant. In addition, the Mg-0.1Pr alloy exhibits a significantly lowered RE transfer and accumulation in rats compared to other Mg-RE alloys, which possibly alleviates the RE metabolic burden to main organs. Pr is neither accumulated in the corrosion product layer nor in the surrounding bones.

Current antiinflammatory therapies lack specificity, often leading to systemic immune suppression. To address this challenge, this study develops a nanosilicon-based hydrogen (H2)-generating nanostructure coated with a positively charged copolymer layer, specifically designed for targeted immunomodulation within VAT. Following intraperitoneal administration in high-fat diet-fed obese mice, the positively charged H2-generating nanostructure selectively accumulates in the expanded extracellular matrix of obese VAT through electrostatic attraction to its negatively charged components. Once accumulation, it reacts with body fluids to sustainably generates H2. This continuous H2 release reprograms the local immune microenvironment by balancing pro-inflammatory M1 and anti-inflammatory M2 adipose tissue macrophages, effectively mitigating VAT inflammation and restoring adipocyte function. In addition to its localized effects, this intervention improves systemic lipid and glucose metabolism, highlighting its potential to address obesity-associated metabolic dysfunctions. By targeting VAT inflammation with high specificity and minimal side effects, this H2-based nanotechnology offers a promising therapeutic strategy for obesity and its related metabolic disorders.","Engineering, Biomedical",Targeted immunomodulation with H2-generating nanostructures to mitigate obesity-induced inflammation and metabolic dysfunctions,,[]

However, the effects of different post-curing protocols on the surface hardness and optical stability of these materials remain underexplored. Purpose: To evaluate the influence of various post-curing protocols on surface hardness and optical properties-including color change and translucency-of a 3D-printed resin composite for permanent crowns. Materials and methods: Disc-shaped specimens (10 mm x 1 mm, n = 10 per group) were fabricated using a 3D-printable resin composite. Post-curing protocols included exposure to 405 nm light (Wash & Cure Plus for 30 or 60 min; ProCure 1 ONX-mode) and to 385 nm light (ProCure 2 in ""Surgery Guide"" and ""Bego"" modes). The control group consisted of non-post-cured samples. After 24 h, surface Vickers hardness (200 g load for 15 s) and color change and translucency (L*, a*, b*, and translucency parameter-TP00) were measured using a benchtop spectrophotometer. After 7 days, all samples received an additional 40 s of light exposure simulating cementation, and color changes (Delta E00) were reassessed. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc test (alpha = 0.05). Results: Hardness values significantly increased with curing time and wavelength (p < 0.001), with ProCure 2 yielding the highest values. Translucency remained stable, regardless of the tested group. The highest color change was observed in the non-cured group (Delta E00 = 3.21 +/- 0.27) and decreased significantly with the post-curing procedures, especially with the 385 nm-based source (Delta E00 = 1.02 +/- 0.18). Conclusions: Post-curing significantly enhances the surface hardness and long-term color stability of 3D-printed resin composites compared to uncured samples. While a 385 nm light source provides the greatest hardness, it may induce initial yellowing that could be clinically unacceptable.","Engineering, Biomedical",Post-curing strategies for enhanced polymerization and color stability in 3D-printed composite crowns,,[]

Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) accumulate in brain tissue as we age, co-localizing with amyloid (3 and tau in the brains of elderly and Alzheimer's disease patients. However, the link between increased AGE levels, aging, and neurodegeneration remains unclear. To explore the effect and mechanism of AGEs on the brain, we developed a neurovascular (NV) model that reflects features of an aged brain by integrating an AGE-anchored matrix. Under AGE-incorporated conditions, we observed brain endothelial dysfunction and microglial activation, leading to increased neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Notably, we discovered that targeting AGE and its receptor could attenuate AGE-mediated neurodysfunction through the histone-modifying enzyme, KMT2A, in neurons within an aged NV model. Our findings in the NV model align with those observed in aged and Alzheimer's disease mouse models. This aged brain model offers a valuable platform for elucidating the epigenetic mechanisms of brain aging and provides insights into novel anti-aging strategies for age-associated brain disorders.","Engineering, Biomedical",Extracellular matrix glycation epigenetically regulates brain aging and neurodegeneration in the in vitro aged neurovascular model,,[]

Recently, photocontrolled pyroptosis has emerged as a promising strategy within photodynamic therapy (PDT). Nonetheless, most existing photosensitizers exhibit a reliance on both type I and type II reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which not only leads to suboptimal efficacy in hypoxic tumor environments but also limits therapeutic depth and selectivity. In this study, we report a lysosome-targeted aggregation-induced emission (AIE) photosensitizer, PTQ-TPA3, engineered through receptor unit loop fusion and rotor integration via molecular evolution strategies. PTQ-TPA3 uniquely achieves highly efficient pure type I ROS generation, alongside near-infrared-II (NIR-II) fluorescence emission and photothermal conversion properties. Under the guidance of multimodal imaging modalities, including photoacoustic, NIR-II fluorescence, and photothermal imaging, PTQ-TPA3 nanoparticles enable synergistic photodynamic and photothermal therapy to drive robust ICD-mediated phototherapy. Furthermore, PTQ-TPA3 demonstrates exceptional efficacy in hypoxic tumor environments by producing pure type I ROS while leveraging its photothermal effect to induce pyroptosis. This dual mechanism effectively eradicates cancer cells and stimulates systemic antitumor immunity, paving the way for innovative therapeutic strategies.","Engineering, Biomedical",Electron acceptor motif-manipulated NIR-II AIE photosensitizers synergically induce tumor pyroptosis through multimodal image-guided pure type I photodynamic and photothermal therapy,,[]

Traditional therapeutic approaches are often associated with complications such as donor site morbidity and immune rejection, underscoring the necessity for the development of advanced strategies. This review examines H-type blood vessels, a recently identified subtype that plays a pivotal role in linking osteogenesis and angiogenesis. These vessels are distinguished by specific functional phenotypes and are characterized by high co-expression of CD31 and endomucin (Emcn). While various strategies have been explored to enhance osteogenesis, inadequate vascularization remains a major obstacle in effective bone defect repair. Here, we categorize and critically evaluate biomaterials based on their compositions, which facilitate the formation of H-type vessels in the bone microenvironment by modulating key signaling pathways that promote osteogenic-angiogenic coupling. The integration of findings from diverse animal models provides valuable insights into the design principles of materials that optimize the formation of vascular networks alongside bone regeneration. This review also discusses the persisting challenges and potential future directions for the development of clinically translatable biomaterial therapies aimed at achieving functional restoration of vascularized bone tissue.

While chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy shows promise for other haematological malignancies, its application to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is hindered by tumour heterogeneity and off-target toxicity. Combining CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing with CAR T-cell therapy has potential for selectively targeting AML cells while sparing healthy tissue. However, validating the efficacy of these treatments prior to clinical trial is hampered by the differences between humans and animal models typically used for pre-clinical testing. Furthermore, traditional in vitro models fail to replicate the complexity of the BM niche and often overestimate treatments' efficacy. Here, we present a bioengineered human-cell containing endosteal BM niche model combining a fibronectin-presenting polymeric surface and a synthetic peptide hydrogel (PeptiGel) that mimics native BM tissue's mechanical properties. This platform supports niche phenotypes in MSCs and HSCs and enables the evaluation of combined CRISPR-CAR T-cell therapy, demonstrating potential as a preclinical human model for testing novel therapies.","Engineering, Biomedical",Synthetic peptide hydrogels as a model of the bone marrow niche demonstrate efficacy of a combined CRISPR-CAR T-cell therapy for acute myeloid leukaemia,,[]

Clinical treatments, including autografts, allografts, and artificial implants, face challenges such as the need for secondary surgery, uncertain retention time, and immune rejection. Hydrogels, as promising regenerative biomaterials, offer excellent biocompatibility and three-dimensional structural support; however, traditional hydrogels frequently struggle to simultaneously provide both mechanical strength and potent biological cues for bone regeneration. Herein we report a methacrylated gelatin hydrogel covalently crosslinked by vinyl-coated iron oxide nanoparticles. In this system, the nanoparticles act as structural hubs to strengthen the polymer network, allowing for the combined regulation of mechanical and biological properties while also providing the unique functional properties of iron. The nanoparticle-crosslinked hydrogels exhibited improved mechanical properties and bone induction compared to conventional crosslinked hydrogels. They showed increased stiffness while maintaining excellent biocompatibility. Due to the positive effects of iron oxide on angiogenesis and osteogenesis induction, the hybrid hydrogel can promote the in vitro osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) and angiogenesis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In the cranial defects of the rat experiment, the iron oxide nanoparticles crosslinked hydrogels enhanced the vascular structure regeneration and bone regrowth. Thus, the nanoparticles-crosslinked hydrogels substantially enhanced neovascularization and accelerated new bone formation. This study provided valuable insights for the design of metal oxide nanoparticles crosslinked hydrogels for bone tissue engineering and supplied a new strategy for efficient and safe craniofacial bone repair. This study presents a powerful design principle where a single nanomaterial component is engineered to resolve the long-standing trade-off between mechanical stability and sustained bioactivity, supplying a new strategy for efficient and safe craniofacial bone repair.","Engineering, Biomedical",Functional iron oxide nanoparticles cross-linked hydrogel for craniofacial bone regeneration,,[]

Iatrogenic injuries from the craniotomy, IME insertion, and the continued presence of the implanted device all evoke a temporally mediated neuroinflammatory response. Transcriptomic analyses have emerged as a highly sensitive and detailed approach to characterizing and quantifying the neuroinflammatory response to IME implantation. Therefore, we used transcriptomic analyses to update the historic characterization of the component injuries associated with IME devices to differentiate surgical and device-related contributions to neuroinflammation and provide an updated view of a decades-old problem. Four injury profiles-uninjured, craniotomy-only, stab wound, and implant-were applied to each rat in different locations corresponding to traditional IME placement. At 2, 8, or 16 weeks after surgery, tissue was extracted and processed using bulk transcriptomic analysis with a custom panel of 212 genes related to neuroinflammation and neuronal health. Many genes were significantly differentially expressed compared to na & iuml;ve controls across time points, with highly similar gene and pathway profiles observed across the craniotomy-only, stab wound, and implant groups. Additionally, the uninjured tissue region also exhibited neuroinflammation-related gene expression changes. The results presented here suggest that the neuroinflammatory response due to the intracortical implant can extend to distal brain regions. The persistent and widespread neuroinflammatory response indicates a need for novel strategies to minimize the iatrogenic effects of neural implants and suggests that the placement of additional implants for increased tissue access may come at the cost of exacerbating neuroinflammation.","Engineering, Biomedical",Transcriptomic analysis of the physiological responses to injuries induced accompanying intracortical microelectrode implantation,,[]

Here, we provide an overview of strontium's use as a treatment for osteoporosis, and report current advances in biomaterials designed to deliver strontium locally to the skeleton from bioactive glasses, calcium phosphates, bone cements, polymers, and implant coatings. Strontium's putative mechanisms of action on bone, including by directly stimulating osteoblasts and osteoclasts and through physicochemical interactions with the bone mineral are discussed. We also appraise dosing, noting discrepancies between in vitro stimulatory ranges and concentrations likely to be achieved in vivo. Strontium-releasing materials are widely reported to be efficacious in preclinical models, but there is very limited human experience. Thus, we also focus on translational issues, including dose and release quantification, safety and systemic exposure monitoring, regulatory pathways, and manufacturing constraints. The review concludes with recommendations for future studies to elucidate strontium's biological and physicochemical mechanisms of action, guidance to refine delivery strategies, and a call to standardise the reporting of dosing.

Due to their capacity to modulate reactive oxygen species (ROS), PBNZs are considered a promising tool for immune modulation, particularly in the directional regulation of macrophage polarization. However, the biological dynamics of pH-dependent multienzyme activity in cells remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the intracellular localization of PBNZs is a critical factor in their regulation of ROS and macrophage polarization. Smaller-sized PBNZs (3 nm) efficiently bypass acidic lysosomal environments (pH 4.6) and accumulate in the cytosol (pH 7.4) where they exhibit reduced POD-mimic activity and enhanced CAT- and SOD-mimic functions. Conversely, larger-sized PBNZs (60 nm and 170 nm) predominantly remained in acidic lysosomes (pH 4.6), exhibiting stronger POD-mimic activity but minimal CAT-mimic function. Additionally, we identify hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a) as a potential mediator that senses alterations in intracellular oxygen(O-2) levels induced by PBNZs, thus modulating the transcription of genes involved in macrophage polarization. Moreover, oral administration with 3 nm PBNZs effectively mitigated dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced acute colitis in mice, owing to their great capacity to modulate macrophage function. Our study provides insights into the complex behavior of multi-enzymatic PBNZs within the intracellular milieu, reveals their protective effect in treating colitis, and offers a foundational rationale for the tailored design of multi-enzymic nanozymes with specific macrophage modulatory properties for prophylactic applications.","Engineering, Biomedical",Subcellular distribution of Prussian blue nanozymes dictates enzymatic activity and macrophage polarization for effective colitis therapy,,[]

Here, the reversible shear stress induced in thixotropic hydrogels under bionic cyclic stretching (5 % strain, and 0.5, 1 or 1.5 Hz) has been demonstrated to significantly accelerate endothelial cell adhesion, migration, and angiogenesis. These dynamic mechanical responses are precisely quantified and monitored through computational simulations and specially designed experimental apparatus. Mechanistic investigations reveals that the mechanically regulated cell behavior is mediated by cell adhesion molecules and calcium signaling pathways, which can be inhibited using Talin bloker (e.g., neomycin) and L-type voltage-gated calcium channel antagonists (e.g., verapamil), respectively. Furthermore, subcutaneous implantation of thixotropic hydrogels in rats results in denser and more rapid vascularization compared to non-thixotropic hydrogels.

These cells are adept at migrating into hypoxic niches within the bone marrow, thereby evading chemotherapeutic agents and retaining their stem-like properties. This evasion facilitates their survival and subsequent regeneration following treatment, significantly contributing to disease relapse and highlighting the need for novel therapeutic interventions. Herein, we present the development of an innovative polymer-drug/siRNA delivery system engineered to respond to hypoxic microenvironments within the bone marrow. This system enables the precision co-delivery of the CXCR4 antagonist plerixafor and siRNA targeting mitochondrial fission protein 1 (Fis1), which induces mitophagy to LSCs. By disrupting the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis and downregulating Fis1 expression, the system effectively impedes LSCs migration and concurrently suppresses mitochondrial autophagy, thereby diminishing the stemness of LSCs. Our findings demonstrate that this dual-action delivery system (PPLazo/ siFis1@C) significantly enhances the efficacy of conventional chemotherapeutic agents by concurrently inhibiting LSCs migration and impairing stemness.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs), a critical subset within tumor tissues, exacerbate this acidity through overexpression of pH-regulating proteins such as carbonic anhydrase IX (CA9), which plays a pivotal role in maintaining pH homeostasis, contributes to immune suppression, and sustains CSC stemness and proliferation. In this study, we designed CA9 inhibitor (CAi) coupled hydroxyethyl starch-based nanoparticles (CHHD-Cu NPs) that integrate doxorubicin (DOX) mediated chemotherapy with copper ions (Cu2+) mediated chemodynamic therapy to target and eliminate CA9-expressing CSCs. Upon administration, CHHD-Cu NPs bind to CA9 and disrupt pH regulation, thereby lowering intracellular pH and raising extracellular pH. This pH modulation enhances intracellular releases of DOX and Cu2+ and alleviates extracellular acidity to boost effector T cells infiltration and activity. Our rationally designed CHHD-Cu NPs eliminate CSCs in two ways: firstly, by robust intracellular DOX-and copper-induced cytotoxicity, and secondly, via pH modulation-mediated activation of anti-tumor immunity.

Because the corrosion reaction rate and surface crystalline phase change according to the fluoride concentration, it is assumed that the fluoride concentration in the electrolyte will affect bone bonding and mechanical properties. However, few studies have investigated this. In this study, zirconium was anodized in an electrolyte containing 0-1 M NH4F, and apatite formation in a simulated body fluid was investigated for in vitro evaluation of bone bonding. Adhesion of the apatite layer to the substrate was also investigated. Differences in the NH4F concentration had a negligible effect on the apatite formation ability of zirconium.

Specifically, the process of blood exposure immediately after implantation triggers an immune response aimed at removing foreign substances, which can lead to thrombosis, inflammation and device malfunction. To confer anticoagulant properties to the implanted devices, a nano-selenium hydrogel coating which was in-situ self-growing on implant devices had been developed that inhibited thrombosis by intervening in the inflammatory cell activation pathway, possibly by decreasing tissue factor activity and thrombin production expressed by inflammatory cells. Compared with the selenium-free coating, the nano-selenium hydrogel coating significantly inhibited macrophage activation, as demonstrated by reduced M1 phenotype and increased M2 phenotype polarization, resulting in a 146 % increase in the M2/M1 ratio, together with the reduction of secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. More importantly, the selenium coating reduced macrophage procoagulant activity through macrophage inactivation, resulting in decreased tissue factor (TF) release and thrombin production. Remarkably, the coating suppressed the coagulation response in a rabbit model of LPS-induced inflammation and in patients with clinical sepsis, thereby reducing thrombus formation manifested by decreased fibrin deposition and reduced monocyte markers. Further studies demonstrated that coated central venous catheters (CVCs) in rabbit and pig vascular models diminished thrombosis and vascular inflammatory activation.

The cell-laden ARGH microgels (GelMA/HAMA microgels containing AuNCs-miRNA) serving as building blocks for rapid engineering tissue construction, demonstrate the capacity for the one-step promotion of hepatic differentiation of stem cells for a short period of time. Additionally, the bioengineered liver microtissues exhibit multiple biological functionalities, including scavenging ROS, modulating inflammatory environment, and promoting angiogenesis, and can maintain long-term stability after transplantation in vivo. Furthermore, our findings reveal that the in vivo transplantation of the bioengineered liver microtissues offers therapeutic benefits in two drug-induced liver failure experimental models. The transcriptome sequencing analysis further elucidates that the microtissue transplantation ameliorated liver failure by improving liver biofunctions, reducing inflammation and oxidative stress, thereby promoting liver regeneration. Overall, this study presents an effective approach leveraging functional biomaterials and microfluidic techniques to fabricate artificial liver microtissues for liver failure treatment.","Engineering, Biomedical",Microfluidic fabricated cell-laden microgels aggregated into artificial liver microtissue to ameliorate drug-induced liver injury,,[]

However, most existing inks fail to meet all these criteria, with processability and repeatability remaining major bottlenecks. This challenge is particularly serious in printed electronics technologies, such as Aerosol Jet (R) Printing (AJ (R) P), for which commercially available formulations tailored to specific applications are still scarce. Here, we present a novel poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)-based ink incorporating polyethylene glycol, ethylene glycol, and carboxymethyl cellulose to obtain a composite that fulfils all requirements, being conductive, processible by AJ (R) P and biocompatible. The formulation exhibits high conductivity (sigma = 495.29 S cm(-1)), electrochemical stability, and biocompatibility with both human fibroblasts and iPSC-derived neural stem cells. Its low viscosity (mu = 7.93 mPa s) enables precise and repeatable AJ (R) P fabrication while supporting controlled, high-resolution 2D patterning and 3D microfabrication with aspect ratios up to 9. Dense or hollow microarrays of 24 flexible pillars (diameter >= 35 mu m; elastic modulus = 3.1 x 10(6) Pa per pillar) can be fabricated within 10 min, without masks or supporting materials.

Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands are recognized as effective stimulators of DC maturation. Another critical factor in DC maturation is interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), which amplifies the TLR signaling pathway and elevates the expression of inflammatory cytokines in DCs. Furthermore, IFN-gamma can markedly enhance the synthesis of interleukin-12 (IL-12) and facilitates T cells in recognizing tumor cells. Consequently, IFN-gamma and TLR ligands is utilized to generate mature DCs (mDCs) for the development of clinical tumor vaccines aimed at treating solid tumors. However, the technology facilitating the co-delivery of IFN-gamma and TLR ligands to DCs is currently limited. Here, we engineered a strategy utilizing modified bacterial biomimetic vesicles (BBVs) as a delivery system, which effectively stimulated the maturation and migration of DCs, facilitating the differentiation of CD4+ Th1 cells and CD8+ CTLs, thereby surface displaying IFN-gamma and TLR ligands on the BBVs. The engineered BBV/IFN-gamma which carry human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV 16) E7 protein and a fusion peptide of three 4T1 neoantigens, respectively triggered Th1/CTLs-polarized T cell responses, promoted tumoral effector T cells infiltration and reshaped the tumor microenvironment, and significantly inhibited tumor growth and metastasis in the TC-1 tumor and orthotopic immune cold 4T1 breast tumor model. Furthermore, the tumor vaccine exhibited synergistic effects with anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. In conclusion, the functionally modified BBVs demonstrate significant potential to overcome immunosuppression and elicit effective anti-tumor immunity.","Engineering, Biomedical",Genetically modified bacterial vesicles with interferon-γ and tumor antigen remodel anti-tumor cellular immunity by modulating dendritic cells,,[]

Current approaches, however, remain strained by suboptimal spatial resolution and low procedural efficiency. Additionally, conventional electromagnetic localization techniques based on image registration face challenges in soft tissue deformation scenarios. Here, we developed an electromagnetic localization technology for intraluminal tumor localization based on injectable magnetic hydrogel with sustained magnetization properties (MagLabel-IH). Following endoscopic injection into the gastrointestinal tract and in situ realignment, MagLabel-IH enables continuous intraluminal magnetic signal tracing. Intraoperatively, a dynamic registration framework synchronizes magnetic coordinate system with real-time anatomical positions under visual guidance, achieving precise localization of optically invisible intraluminal tumors. The system demonstrated exceptional surgical instrument maneuverability (e.g., tissue grasping, resection path selection) during MagLabel-IH detection. In vivo animal evaluations demonstrated significantly enhanced localization accuracy compared to conventional biological tattooing (3.8 +/- 0.8 mm vs. 16.8 +/- 8.6 mm, P < 0.05).

Nevertheless, conferring bio-functions through facile strategies remains a challenge. Herein, a modified electrospinning method was firstly developed to fabricate polycaprolactone (PCL) single yarn-based sutures (SYSs), which all showed nanofibrous micro-structure and highly aligned configuration. By adjusting the concentration of PCL solution and spinning time, a series of PCL SYSs with adjustable suture diameter and mechanical properties could be easily generated. As the solution concentration was raised from 6 % to 21 %, both the suture diameter and the nanofiber diameter increased substantially, ranging from approximately 273 to 640 mu m and from around 417 to 1091 nm, respectively. Correspondingly, the breaking load rose to around 35 N, while the knotting load reached about 20 N. Similarly, when the spinning time was extended from 5 to 25 min, the suture diameter increased from nearly 270 to 594 mu m, and both the breaking load and knotting load exhibited substantial improvements, attaining values around 43 N and 27 N, respectively. In contrast, the nanofiber diameter remained largely unchanged with spinning time, as electrospinning parameters were maintained constant. Then, a twisting post-treatment process was employed to process three strands of PCL SYSs into thread-based sutures (TSs), and it was found that the twisting degree had significant influences on the structure and mechanical properties of finally-obtained TSs. Increasing the twist degree from 3 to 7 twists/cm resulted in a reduction in the suture diameter of TSs from 455 to 363 mu m and an enhancement in the ultimate stress from approximately 128 to 215 MPa, accompanied by superior knotting stability. In addition, the in vitro cell test demonstrated that the PCL nanofibrous sutures allowed the human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) to adhere and proliferate on their surface and enabled cells to migrate along the suture longitudinal direction in a rapid manner. Furthermore, the hemolytic test proved the blood safety of PCL nanofibrous sutures, ensuring that they could be applied in clinical practice without causing complications such as inflammation or thrombosis. In all, this study proposed a simple method by combining modified electrospinning with twisting post-treatment to generate innovative PCL nanofibrous SYSs and TSs with modulated morphology, micro-structure, and performances, which showed huge potential as a promising candidate for absorbent surgical suture applications.","Engineering, Biomedical","A facile strategy to modulate the morphology, micro-structure, and performances of electrospun polycaprolactone nanofibrous sutures",,[]

In this study, we developed multifunctional nanospheres encapsulated with Fusobacterium nucleatum-derived outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) to target periodontal pathogens specifically. These OMVs act as a ""camouflage,"" allowing the nanospheres to infiltrate bacterial environments undetected, adhere to pathogen surfaces, and maximize therapeutic effects. Direct contact between nanospheres and bacteria accelerates electron transfer, and nanospheres trigger a proliferation of endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to oxidative stress and bacterial death. Transcriptomic analysis confirmed that the nanospheres accelerated electron transfer activity and disrupted deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair mechanisms and thiamine metabolism while enhancing bacterial respiration. Though supported by dual photodynamic and photothermal therapies under near-infrared light, the primary mechanism of action focuses on electron transfer and metabolic disruption. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated the nanospheres' potent biofilm eradication and periodontitis treatment efficacy, offering a promising new approach for selective bacterial targeting. This strategy targets pathogens effectively and preserves the beneficial microbiota, providing an innovative solution for treating periodontitis and other biofilm-related infections.","Engineering, Biomedical",NIR-activated nanodisguisers for targeted bactericidal action and enhanced electron transfer in periodontitis treatment,,[]

Instead, hPSCs are typically cultivated on surfaces coated with Matrigel, which includes xeno-containing substances. Hence, it is advisable to employ biomaterials conjugated to synthetic peptides to promote hPSCs proliferation. hPSCs have been successfully cultured for more than 10 passages on surfaces conjugated to specific peptides derived from extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. However, the concentration of peptide solution needed for conjugation is high (typically >1000 mu g/mL). To overcome this limitation, novel cell culture biomaterials using a polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimer-based peptide-conjugated surface, which allow high peptide surface density locally, were developed in this study. We successfully cultured hPSCs on a PAMAM dendrimer surface conjugated to a specific peptide designed on the basis of the laminin beta 4 chain; this surface was generated with a low concentration of peptide (50 mu g/mL) that was on the same order of magnitude as that used to coat the surface with ECM solution (5-10 mu g/ mL). After long-term (10 passages) cultivation on the peptide-conjugated dendrimer surface, hPSCs exhibited pluripotency and the potential to differentiate into cells from all three germ layers, as well as cardiomyocytes for the treatment of myocardial infarction and retinal pigment epithelial cells for the treatment of retinal pigmentosa disease. 3D peptide conjugation (immobilization) at high density on the surface via the PAMAM dendrimer supports maintenance of hPSC pluripotency via low concentrations of peptides during long-term cultivation.","Engineering, Biomedical",Conjugation of peptides to a dendrimer surface to promote the proliferation and differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into cardiomyocytes and retinal pigment epithelium,,[]

LNPs not only protect mRNA from degradation during systemic circulation but also facilitate its intracellular uptake and endosomal release. However, the endosomal release efficiency of standard LNPs has been shown to be poor, limiting the transfection efficiency. Here, we explored incorporating a biodegradable polymer which only contains tertiary amines as a pH-sensitive functional group into LNPs, aiming to introduce the proton sponge effect to facilitate the endosomal release. We developed a series of novel LNP formulations by spiking the polymers with different molecular weights into LNPs at a range of ratios. Our results demonstrated that the polymer-modified LNPs (p-LNPs) maintained a particle size of approximately 80 nm, a neutral surface charge, and an mRNA encapsulation efficiency >90 %, along with increased pH buffering capacity. The optimal p-LNP formulation tripled the cellular uptake and enhanced the endosomal escape efficiency from 20 % to 80 % compared to the standard LNPs. Furthermore, cells treated with the p-LNP formulation at 1 mg/mL showed no cytotoxicity. Upon intravenous administration, the optimal p-LNP formulation loaded with luciferase mRNA significantly increased the transgene expression evidenced by a 100-fold increase in luciferin bioluminescence from the liver compared to the standard LNPs. Moreover, p-LNPs did not elevate inflammatory cytokines in the treated mice, including IFN-gamma, IL1 beta, TNF alpha, and IL6.","Engineering, Biomedical",Biodegradable polymers with tertiary amines enhance mRNA delivery of lipid nanoparticles via improved endosomal escape,,[]
,0,2026-02-01,BIOMATERIALS,"Calcification associated with atherosclerosis is a major driver of morbidity globally. Despite the correlation of calcification with plaque rupture and sudden death, there are no clinically approved therapies that treat vascular calcification. Notably, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) represent a promising target to inhibit vascular calcification, as VSMCs are the primary source of calcification deposition in the vasculature. To that end, we report a novel approach using extracellular vesicles (EVs) to deliver anti-osteogenic miR-133 to osteochondrogenic VSMCs in atherosclerosis. Traditionally, loading miRs into EVs is marred by low loading efficiency, inefficient EV modification, miR degradation, or loss of EV structural integrity. To address these challenges, VSMCs were transduced to create cell lines expressing miR-133 modified with ExoMotifs, or 4-8 nucleotide motifs which enable binding to proteins involved in miR sorting, resulting in VSMCs that secrete EVs highly loaded with miR-133. Additionally, EVs were surface functionalized with a hydroxyapatite binding peptide (HABP) to enable targeting to areas of vascular calcification. Our results show that HABP-miR-133-EVs can inhibit osteochondrogenic VSMCs, promote contractile VSMCs genes, and inhibit vascular calcification both in vitro and in vivo in murine atherosclerosis models. More broadly, we demonstrate a platform strategy to develop cellular factories for miR-loaded, therapeutic EVs that can be tailored for a variety of diseases.","Engineering, Biomedical",Genetically engineering cells to produce therapeutically boosted extracellular vesicles for cardiovascular calcification,,[]

Given the central role of kidney in lactic acid (LA) metabolism and the emerging potential of LA as a predictor of renal pathology, a modular surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) platform featuring with a simple ""capture-detection"" coordination mechanism was presented, facilitating a novel diagnostic strategy based on the identification and detection of urinary lactate enantiomers. Leveraging on the intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions, a precise enantiomeric resolution was achieved, yielding an exceptional enhancement factor (EF) of 2.45 x 106 and a low limit of detection (LOD) of 10- 14.35 M and 10- 13.50 M for lactate enantiomers. It was notable that the aberrant urinary D-lactate (D-LA) levels enabled auxiliary discrimination between MCD and FSGS, enabling noninvasive discrimination with high diagnostic accuracy. To a certain extent, these findings established D-LA as a promising biomarker for chronic kidney disease (CKD). This SERS-based approach addresses the critical limitations of current traditional diagnosis, not only advancing chiral analysis but also offering a transformative opportunity for early diagnosis, disease monitoring, and mechanistic studies in nephrology.","Engineering, Biomedical",A lactate capture-sensing platform for facilitating early differential diagnosis of minimal change disease and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in renal diseases,,[]

To address this challenge, we developed a multifunctional composite nanozyme (AgAu C-L, formed by covalent conjugation of AgAu@CeO2 with Lactobacillus reuteri) by anchoring an ultrasmall cerium dioxide (CeO2) nanozyme with peroxidase (POD)-like activity onto silver-gold nanocages (AgAu NCs), and integrating it with Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri). Upon near-infrared light irradiation, the localized surface plasmon resonance effect of AgAu NCs induced dual regulatory mechanisms: photothermal heating, which elevated local temperature to enhance catalytic efficiency, and interfacial electron transfer, which promoted Ce3+/Ce4+ redox cycling to sustain catalytic activity. Simultaneously, L. reuteri modulated the local pH through the secretion of lactic and acetic acids, creating a favorable acidic microenvironment for enzyme function. This triple-modulation strategy markedly enhanced the POD-like activity of CeO2, triggering a robust reactive oxygen species burst that effectively disrupted periodontal biofilms and eliminated pathogenic bacteria. Furthermore, the composite interfered with microbial metabolic pathways, reducing biofilm formation and virulence.

Due to lack of precise diagnosis and timely intervention, many patients with ALI rapidly progress to liver dysfunction and liver failure. Here, a multifunctional silybin nano-prodrug, PTS@IR, was developed that integrated microenvironment-activatable second near-infrared (NIR-II) fluorescence (FL) imaging for precise diagnosis and timely therapy of ALI. The PTS@IR was formed through the self-assembly of a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-cleavable thioketal (TK) linker that connected polyethylene glycol and the clinical hepatoprotective drug silybin, followed by encapsulation of the NIR-II fluorescent dye IR 1061. In in vitro oxidative stress cell models, PTS@IR restored the quenched NIR-II FL, significantly alleviated cellular oxidative damage, and inhibited cell apoptosis. After intravenous injection into liver ischemia-reperfusion injury (LIRI) and drug-induced liver injury (DILI) mouse models, the PTS@IR specifically lit up the site of liver injury via NIR-II FL imaging, enabling highly sensitive diagnosis and real-time therapeutic monitoring of ALI. Activated by excess ROS in the pathological microenvironment, the nano-prodrug underwent in situ degradation and released silybin for on-demand therapy. Timely dual antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects and inhibition of ferroptosis through modulation of the Nrf2/GPX4 axis collectively alleviated ALI. Notably, the PTS@IR could be completely degraded into small molecules, effectively avoiding the potential metabolic burden and toxic side effects of conventional nanodrugs.

The suboptimal efficacy of current treatments underscores an urgent need for more effective immunomodulatory strategies. Here, we propose a ROS-responsive resiquimod (R848) prodrug (R-P) that improves drug delivery and reshapes the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and patient samples underscore the therapeutic value of targeting CD206 and TLR7/8 to repolarize tumor-associated macrophages. The prodrug R-P is created by conjugating a phenylboronic acid pinacol ester moiety to R848 via a succinic anhydride linker, enabling the prodrug to remain stable in systemic circulation while releasing its parent compound in the oxidative tumor microenvironment, thereby minimizing off-target effects. Further, mannose-functionalized nanoparticles (R-P@APM-DPs) achieve an impressive loading capacity of R848 (34.3 %) and exhibit robust ROS-responsive release. In a murine MB49 bladder cancer model, R-P@APM-DPs significantly reduce tumor growth, enhance M1 macrophages, and increase CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, while decreasing the number of immunosuppressive cells. Notably, combination therapy with anti-PD-1 leads to a potent anticancer response in both MB49-bearing mice and patient-derived organoids.

Herein, we synthesized a ROS-cleavable thioacetal (TA)-linked precursor with multiple reactivities from scratch using a simple, rapid (<1 h), and efficient one-step 'thiol-alkyne' click chemistry approach. This precursor served as the structural framework for producing a three-dimensional, highly hyperbranched polymer (HBP(TA)) via a mutual esterification cross-linking reaction. Following surface conjugation with brain-targeted borneol-PEG (Bo), the polymer self-assembled into Bo-HBP(TA) NPs through a kinetically controlled assembly process, effectively encapsulating rapamycin. This nanoformulation administered intravenously in MCAO mice efficiently across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to reach the targeted lesion and allowed for dynamically ROSresponsive on-demand release of payload under fluctuating pathophysiological conditions, achieving drug accumulation in the brain of up to 12.1 %ID/g of total administered dosage. The structural disintegration of NPs competitively scavenged intrinsic ROS, while the released rapamycin effectively activated mitophagy and restored autophagy flux (Beclin-1/Atg5/LC3/p62 axis) to remove dysfunctional mitochondria, thereby mitigating ongoing ROS production and inhibiting mitochondrial apoptosis (Bcl-2/Bax/Cleaved-Caspase-3 axis), leading to a 96.9 % reduction in apoptotic neurons. Furthermore, it remodeled the cerebral neuro-inflammatory microenvironment by promptly reprogramming microglia towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype (increased by 10.7-fold) and lowering pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion (TNF-alpha/IL-6/IL-1 beta decreased by 60 %). Consequently, the treatment significantly declined the infarction area from 46.2 % to 1.1 %, effectively normalized neurological structure and function, restored BBB integrity, and inhibited the microvascular leakage into the brain parenchyma during late reperfusion, offering a pathogenesis-adaptive sequential anti-stroke treatment strategy with huge clinical translational potential.","Engineering, Biomedical",Dynamic ROS-responsive hyperbranched polymer-based neuroprotective drug delivery system for pathogenesis-adaptive sequential therapy of cerebral ischemic stroke,,[]

Comparison between methods is missing to date especially for (human) biological soft tissues. This given study determined the cross-sectional areas of ten synthetic polyamide 12 and twenty-nine human iliotibial band specimens. It used the following four commonly deployed methods: caliper gauge (CG), molding compound (MC), X-ray micro computed tomography (mu CT) and digital image correlation (DIC). The repeatability coefficient was calculated for the four methods and the agreement between the four methods were compared using Bland-Altman plots. All methods but CG offer consistent and reliable measurements of iliotibial band cross section determination, with no difference in their performance levels. In the polyamide specimens, cross-section determination using mu CT appeared to provide the best repeatability coefficient RC (0.09 mm2 and 0.18 mm2 with reduced voxel resolution). It shows also for iliotibial band specimens the best agreements especially when compared to MC with a bias less than 1 % and limits of agreements lower +/- 25 %. The given data suggest that any of the given methods, mu CT, MC or DIC can be used effectively for CSA measurements of soft tissues. Minor methodological discrepancies were observed exclusively in specimens with highly uniform geometries. The principal limiting factor appears to be inherent tissue-specific variability rather than the measurement precision of the applied systems.

The scaffold is composed of radially aligned poly(epsilon-caprolactone) nanofibers surface-deposited with epidermal growth factor (EGF)-loaded collagen nanoparticles in a radial density gradient, fabricated via coaxial electrospraying. This design enables sustained release of bioactive EGF for up to 10 days while guiding cell migration toward the wound center. In vitro studies demonstrated enhanced directional migration and proliferation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts. Transcriptomic analysis revealed activation of cytoskeletal remodeling, membrane fluidity regulation, and integrin-mediated adhesion pathways, highlighting the scaffold's role in orchestrating cell motility. In a fullthickness rat skin injury model, the scaffold accelerated wound closure, enhanced cell proliferation, and promoted collagen deposition, resulting in skin wound healing. This study presents a simple and versatile platform for delivering spatially graded cues, offering strong potential for clinical translation and extension to other tissue regeneration applications.","Engineering, Biomedical",A radially aligned nanofiber scaffold with engineered guidance gradients for directed cell migration and accelerated wound healing,,[]

To address these limitations, this study developed bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC)-derived exosome mimetics (EMs), produced through an optimized extrusion methodology, which enhanced production yield while preserving the core morphology and structure of natural exosomes with augmented functionality in key biological processes. Furthermore, these EMs are coated with a tannic acid (TA)/Fe3+ coordination network that acts as a protective barrier with antioxidative and antibacterial properties. This coating enables EMs to promote stem cell proliferation, migration, osteogenesis, and immunomodulation under inflammatory and oxidative stress conditions. In vivo, the local injection of EM@[TA-Fe3+] effectively suppressed periodontal inflammation and promoted alveolar bone regeneration.

However, IOB has limited translational potential in its current form secondary to difficulty in establishing a rapidly functional, anastomosed vascular network. Micropuncture (MP) is an innovative microsurgical approach that overcomes this obstacle by creating targeted perforations in the host macrovasculature to stimulate angiogenesis, thereby facilitating microvascular ingrowth into adjacent bioprinted constructs. This study presents the first attempt of MP-induced vascularization of intraoperatively bioprinted constructs (10 mm x 15 mm x 3 mm). After precise optimization of bioink and cell compositions, IOB was performed in rat hindlimbs using rat aortic endothelial cell (RAOEC)-laden bioink to synergistically promote vascularization in conjugation with MP. The combination of MP and RAOECs demonstrated the highest values across all parameters such as a 1.8-fold vessel density increase, 2-fold increase in vessel length, a 2.5-fold increase in PECAM-1 expression, and a 4.2-fold increase in F4/80 expression on Day 40 compared to the bioinkonly group. Additionally, perfusion was observed in bioprinted constructs, confirming functional microvascular anastomoses to the host.

In this study, we present a sequential drug release hydrogel system (SeqGel) that reprograms tumor metabolism and modulates the immune landscape to suppress TNBC growth and metastasis. The poly(ethylene glycol)-based injectable hydrogel system could enable tunable biodegradation within 48 h to ensure repeated peritumoral administration and localized controlled drug release. Specifically, water-soluble small molecular dichloroacetate is rapidly released to redirect tumor cell metabolism from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation, thereby reducing lactic acid accumulation, restricting glucose uptake, and enhancing the susceptibility of cancer cells to mitochondrial damage. This is followed by the sustained release of pH-sensitive, copper complex-loaded polymeric nanoparticles PED@tCu, which facilitates efficient intracellular delivery and targeted mitochondrial localization, specifically impairing the function of complex II. Mechanistically, the ordered metabolic intervention enhances antitumor immunity by activating the AMPK pathway, promoting PD-L1 degradation, and upregulating MHC I to improve antigen presentation. In 4T1 subcutaneous tumor models, SeqGel effectively suppressed tumor growth and markedly reduced lung and lymph node metastases by promoting CD8+ T cell infiltration and depleting regulatory T cells.

Neural stem cells (NSCs) supplementation offers a promising therapeutic avenue by providing seed cells; however, the differentiation rate of NSCs into neurons is often suboptimal. In this study, lithium was immobilized on the surface of ZnO nanoparticles using a polydopamine coating to synthesize Li-PDA@ZnO nanoparticles. These nanoparticles were designed to induce NSC differentiation into neurons in a spatiotemporal-controlled manner using ultrasound-driven stimulation. Additionally, a biohydrogel system consisting of genipin and collagen was developed to encapsulate NSCs preloaded with endocytosed nanoparticles. The application of ultrasound stimulation to ZnO nanoparticles enhanced the differentiation of NSCs into neurons in a concentration-dependent manner following endocytosis. Li-PDA@ZnO nanoparticles demonstrated improved biocompatibility and further promoted neuronal differentiation, a process mediated by molecular pathways involving ERK and ASCL1. In vivo, the ability of ultrasound-driven nanoparticles to enhance NSC differentiation was validated using a mouse SCI contusion model. Furthermore, the combined nanoparticle-biohydrogel system was evaluated in an SCI transection model, where it was found to reduce local inflammation, enhance neuronal differentiation of NSCs, and increase the proportion of functional neurons.

Ferroptosis arising from iron overload represents a crucial pathological characteristic of osteoporosis, depleting osteoblasts and disturbing bone metabolism. Inspired by natural tremella polysaccharide (TP), we developed an injectable composite hydrogel (OGP@DTrep) capable of inhibiting cell ferroptosis via dual mechanisms. Following the incorporation of methacrylated TP, oxidized TP, thioketal (TK), and osteogenic growth peptide (OGP), OGP@DTrep exhibits a range of biological activities including intelligent reactive oxygen species (ROS) response and drug release, immunomodulation, promotion of angiogenesis, and inhibition of osteoclast activity. More importantly, since the carboxyl group in TP and the hydroxyl group of the sugar unit can form salt bridge interactions and hydrogen bond linkages with free iron ions, respectively, OGP@DTrep can efficiently chelate excessive iron ions in the microenvironment. Moreover, OGP@DTrep increases the intracellular antioxidant capacity, inhibits osteoblast ferroptosis, and enhances bone matrix secretion.

At present, significant challenges in developing complex and controllable substitutes for epiphyses persist. In this study, human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (hBMSC) microspheres and recombinant human Indian hedgehog (IHH) were used to simulate the key mechanisms of bone development: mesenchymal condensation and biochemical signaling. The results showed that hBMSC microspheres self-assembled into cartilage-like blocks (SAB) under chondrogenic induction. In addition, the ex vivo regulatory effect of recombinant IHH was related to the concentration and treatment time. Notably, 100 ng/mL IHH significantly enhanced the chondrogenic differentiation efficiency of hBMSC microspheres while shortening the induction period. The internal cells of SAB-100 were in a dynamic balance of proliferation and differentiation, and its matrix morphology was similar to those of natural epiphyses. Therefore, SAB-100 was regarded as a biomimetic epiphysis (BME). In a large-scale epiphyseal defect model, SAB-100 showed superior chondrocyte regeneration potential. Additionally, elevated thrombospondin-2 (THBS2) expression significantly suppressed angiogenesis and bone bridge formation at the defect site, while partially restoring the cellular and matrix homeostasis of adjacent undamaged epiphyses. Ultimately, SAB-100 effectively prevented angular deformities and reduced limb length discrepancies. These findings suggest that exogenous IHH has the potential to reconstruct the IHH regulatory network ex vivo, and SAB-100 is expected to partially restore the developmental function of damaged epiphyses.","Engineering, Biomedical",Biomimetic epiphysis inspired by natural developmental mechanisms promote the repair of large-scale epiphyseal defects,,[]

Although immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown promise in cancer therapy, limitations remain including low response rate, systemic toxicities, and the need of frequent treatments. Here, we described a dual knockout approach targeting PD-L1 and Gal-9 in tumor cells, achieved by nanoparticle-assisted CRISPR-Cas9 delivery, aimed at improved cancer immunotherapy. A calcium phosphate nanoparticle (CaP NP) was engineered for co-delivery of CRISPR-Cas9/sgRNA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) and initiation of anti-tumor immunity. Intratumoral administration of RNP-loaded CaP NPs effectively knocked out PD-L1 and Gal-9 in tumor cells, evoking robust anti-tumor immunity. Additionally, Ca2+ overload due to the degradation of CaP NPs led to release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) signals, further enhancing T-cell-mediated antitumor immune responses.

CLRN reduces oxygen consumption by disrupting glucose metabolic homeostasis in hypoxic environments, leading to a massive generation of reactive oxygen species that further disrupt intracellular redox homeostasis. Additionally, CLRN inhibits DNA methylation to upregulate gasdermin E (GSDME) expression, which cooperates with the amplified oxidative stress to activate the Caspase-3/GSDME pathway and activate immunogenic pyroptosis. As tumor cells undergo immunogenic pyroptosis, they release various damage-associated molecular patterns and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which promote immune cell infiltration.

Because astrocytes dynamically react to the microenvironment and contribute to the neuroinflammatory process, they are well situated as initiators and/or targets for biomaterial-based immunomodulation strategies. To achieve this, we devised and validated an alginate hydrogel encapsulation approach using human pluripotent stem cell-derived astrocytes that enabled a novel coculture system with organoids composed of neurons, astrocytes, and microglia. Encapsulated human astrocytes were able to secrete proteins to the external environment and become reactive in response to stimuli.

Despite the clinical significance of H-ARS, there have been few advances in H-ARS research owing to the dearth of physiologically relevant human models that mimic the complex bone marrow microenvironment. In this study, we used a stage-specific mesodermal differentiation protocol to establish human bone marrow organoids (hBMOs) derived from hiPSCs.

Assessment of their biomimetic potency on the resin-dentin interface [adhesive, hybrid layer (HL), underlying dentin (UD)] involved nano-mechanical dynamic analyses, microtensile bond strength (mu TBS), and interfacial micropermeability after 24 h and 6 months in simulated body fluids. The degree of conversion (DC) of PAC-incorporated dental resins was analyzed via ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. Bound and unbound water in dentin were measured using differential scanning calorimetry. Statistical analysis employed ANOVA and post-hoc tests (alpha = 0.05). A-type PACs increased HL nano-moduli (E '(HL) = 15-17 GPa), and all PACs enhanced UD nano-moduli (E '(UD) = 35-52 GPa) versus control (E '(HL) = 10 GPa; E '(UD) = 25 GPa). AA, BB, and BBB PACs increased damping capacity at HL, while reducing it at the UD (p < 0.001). A-type and BB PACs yielded greater bond strength than control. While nano-moduli in the BB group remained stable over 6 months, others declined, although trimers maintained higher E '(HL,UD) than control (p < 0.001). While AA and BB groups sustained bond strength, AAA displayed higher mu TBS over time. PACs did not adversely affect DC, whereas A-type PACs increased selectively.

Both In silico neuronal models and primary neuron cells have revealed that the branching architecture of individual neurons determines the bioelectrical signal propagation pattern and dynamics. However, whether stem cell-differentiated neurons can build functional connectivity regulated by neuronal morphology has yet to be determined. Here, we hypothesized that neurite length, branching, or both factors would regulate the functional connectivity of the stem cell-differentiated neural network. We examined this hypothesis by differentiating mouse cortical neural stem cells (NSCs) on Matrigel substrates with varying storage moduli, both with and without basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). Interestingly, with bFGF, Matrigel with a storage modulus (G ') of 100 Pa drives NSCs to differentiate into neurons with more dendritic branches, while the gel with G ' of 50 Pa led to the development of longer neurites with fewer branches. Notably, branch-rich neural networks exhibited an increased frequency of calcium transients. Using a MATLAB-based analysis pipeline incorporating graph theory, we constructed spatial and temporal calcium activity maps, revealing that branching complexity, more than neurite length, correlates with the density and strength of functional neural circuits. Overall, this study demonstrates that the dendritic branching of neurons, modulated with matrix stiffness and neurotrophic factors, is a key element in enhancing the electrophysiological functionality of the stem cell-differentiated neural network. This finding will have a significant impact on efforts to reconstruct functional neural tissue models, advancing both regenerative therapies and unexplored applications, including biological computing.","Engineering, Biomedical",Interrogating functional connectivity of in vitro neural glia tissue model modulated through integrative control of matrix stiffness and a neurotrophic factor,,[]

Over the past few decades, even with rapid intraoperative tissue pathology assessment, the overall rate of positive surgical margins for tumors stagnated between 15 % and 60 %. The increased local recurrence rates and poor prognoses associated with various cancers, such as head and neck, brain, breast, lung, prostate, and gastrointestinal cancers, are linked to positive margins. Recently, driven by the concept of precise surgery, significant advancements have been reported in the intraoperative use of fluorescent contrast agents in the field of surgery. Molecular imaging via intraoperative fluorescence plays a guiding role in surgery, providing surgeons with visible fluorescent images. In clinical applications, fluorescent contrast agents can clearly delineate tumor boundaries, offering high recognition capacities and real-time guidance during surgery. Additionally, they can localize lymph node metastases, detect small metastatic lesions, and identify critical anatomical structures during surgery, thus reducing the risk of collateral damage. An ideal surgical guidance technology should lack radiation and display a high sensitivity and good resolution and an adjustable field of view, with rapid imaging. Enhancing the tissue penetration of fluorescence and targeting capacities of molecular probes are critical in providing more comprehensive tumorrelated data. Additionally, screening and identifying other tumor biomarkers and more of their corresponding targeted molecular data are essential in enhancing the specificity of molecular imaging. Finally, the investigation and use of a wider range of near-infrared fluorescent dyes with improved biocompatibilities and imaging are critical in designing synthetic probes for application in intraoperative navigation. The development of novel, efficient, safe fluorescent contrast agents is a critical direction in current pharmaceutical research and development.","Engineering, Biomedical",Translational contrast agents for use in fluorescence image-guided tumor surgery,,[]

In the present study, silk ionomer nanoencapsulation using layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition was utilized as a versatile strategy to provide temporary cell protection from these stresses and preserve cell functions for downstream use. Using THP-1 immune cells, tunable encapsulation of the cells with up to 10 bilayers of silk was demonstrated. Characterization by quartz crystal microbalance (QCM-D) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed nonlinear thickness growth (similar to 800 nm) and peak stiffness of 231 kPa above five bilayers, indicating a transition from rigid initial layer deposition, to softer outer layers. We demonstrate that the silk ionomer coatings preserved cellular functions, including differentiation into M1 and M2 macrophages, the associated cytokine profiles (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-10, TGF-beta), and expression of cell surface markers (CD68, CD206) when compared to the uncoated controls. Notably, these temporary coatings blocked antibody binding to CD14/CD68 receptors and also protected cells from shear stress during extrusion through a 34G needle at 200 mu L/min, resulting in greater than a 70 % increase in cell survival compared to the uncoated cells during extrusion. These results establish silk ionomers as a robust biomaterials platform for enhancing the mechanical resilience and immune evasion of cells in advanced applications, such as for 3D bioprinting, adoptive immunotherapy, and regenerative transplantation.","Engineering, Biomedical",Temporary silk nanocoatings preserve immune cell functions and protection against biochemical and mechanical stressors,,[]

Freezing is examined as a method that may offer an extended window for forensic analysis by halting tissue degradation processes or allow tissue transfer to specialized departments. A rheological examination of samples from various brain regions of 21 ovine brains (frontal lobe, anterior deep brain, posterior deep brain, parietal lobe, superior colliculus, medulla, pons, cerebellum) was conducted. The brain tissue was tested on the day of sacrifice, after short term freezing (<16 days) and long-term freezing (95-110 days) to track the changes in mechanical properties. The results showed nearly complete overlap in storage, loss and complex shear moduli between samples tested on the day of sacrifice and their frozen counterparts for all locations, with no statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) between the moduli of the three groups. Freezing had no statistically significant impact on the tissue's mechanical properties across all tested locations.

In this study, the induction of senescence in human melanoma cells by palbociclib is found to lead to a senescent phenotype characterized by overexpression of the membrane protein dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), previously identified only in ageing contexts. Based on this discovery, a nanoparticle targeting DPP4 overexpression in the senescent surfaceome is designed, synthesized, and characterized to target senescent cancer cells. The nanoparticle based on mesoporous silica is loaded with the senolytic navitoclax, coated with disulfide-containing poly(ethylene glycol) to generate a redox-sensitive gatekeeper (S-S-PEG), and functionalized with an antibody against the DPP4 protein. The ability of the nanoparticles to effectively detect and eliminate senescent cells was confirmed in vitro and in vivo using a mouse model of palbociclib-induced senescent in melanoma. The DPP4-targeted nanoparticle effectively reduces tumor growth and selectively removes senescent cells. Taken together, this study highlights the potential of surfaceome-targeted nanoparticles, as a clinically relevant strategy for improving senolytic therapies.","Engineering, Biomedical",Targeting the senescent surfaceome through DPP4 antibody-functionalized nanoparticles.

Chronic and long-term inflammation drives cancer development, while acute inflammatory reactions often lead to anti-cancer immune responses by stimulating the body's adaptive immunity. However, the over-inflammation post-treatment was usually neglected, which not only impedes therapeutic outcomes but also exacerbates tumor aggressiveness and metastatic spread. Mitigating therapy-induced inflammation has emerged as a critical research frontier to augment therapeutic efficacy and bolster patients' life quality. Herein, the molecular and cellular mechanisms of inflammation induced by cancer therapy as well as the inflammatory side effects were summarized. A range of anti-inflammatory drugs/agents based on emerging biomaterials and novel delivery modalities are compared in light of current clinical advances and experimental results. More importantly, various inflammation-modulating strategies involved in traditional cancer therapies (encompassing surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy) and modern novel treatment strategies such as immunotherapy, photothermal therapy, and combination therapies were discussed in detail.

,0,2026-01-01,JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS,"Due to the PEEK material with a melting point of approximately 343 degrees C and an ambient 3D printing environment temperature of approximately 25 degrees C, the significant temperature gradient between the extruded PEEK material from the printing nozzle and room temperature restricts the alignment of molecular chains within the material. This thermal condition inhibits the formation of well-ordered crystalline structures, consequently reducing both crystallinity and interlayer bonding strength in printed components. To address this, the printing process incorporates a continuous supply of clean, high-temperature air through a hot air gun. This method maintains elevated component temperatures during fabrication, effectively slowing the cooling rate from processing temperature to ambient conditions. The single-factor and orthogonal experimental results show that hightemperature air significantly improves the mechanical properties of 3D-printed PEEK materials, and 240 degrees C is the optimal high-temperature air temperature for maximizing the tensile strength and the bending strength of 3D-printed PEEK components in this study environment. The circular (porous) structure of the implant not only exhibits good compressive strength but also provides higher porosity and surface area, which are beneficial for bone cell ingrowth, proliferation, and diffusion. Furthermore, the compressive strength of a pore structure depends not only on its porosity, but also on the shape of the pore. This study provides theoretical guidance for improving the 3D printing quality of high-melting-point, high-viscosity materials and their composites, especially in terms of 3D printing forming temperature and the design of pore structures for porous implants.","Engineering, Biomedical",Research on the mechanical properties of PEEK material artificial bone implants fabricated by high-temperature air-assisted 3D printing,,[]

Attempts in this field tend to improve the structure and function of nanomotors for safe and efficient treatment. To address the problem of low utilization and high bleeding risk, herein, we present a magnetically-driven cocklebur-like nanomotor for efficient delivery of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) to treat thrombus. Composed of Fe3O4 cores and spiked silicate shells, these nanomotors can rapidly respond to magnetic fields and adhere to the thrombus regardless of the blood flow impact. Besides, we use an H2O2-responsive ester to conjugate rt-PA to the nanomotors, releasing the medication only around the thrombus with abundant reactive oxygen species, thereby ensuring effective potency preservation. In vivo study proves that these cocklebur-like nanomotors can successfully treat a mouse model with a reduced thrombus area of 3.3-fold compared with direct-injection of rt-PA. Also, the coagulation system exhibits no obvious changes. All the results confirm the synergistic effect of magnetic control, adherence, and targeted drug release.

Obeticholic acid (OCA, a farnesoid X receptor agonist) has shown limited efficacy due to poor solubility, single-target mechanisms, and off-target side effects, notwithstanding the great promise of this agent in NASH clinical trials. Here, we designed M2 macrophage-derived membrane (M2M)-camouflaged poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (O@PLGA@M) to achieve targeted OCA delivery to the inflamed liver niche for recovering hepatic homeostasis in NASH. The M2M improved the inflamed liver-targeting of the nanoplatforms via chemotaxis and promoted M1-to-M2 macrophage repolarization, as evidenced by a 2.5-fold increase in CD206 expression and 45 % reduction in CD86 expression in the liver. In a methionine/choline-deficient (MCD) diet-induced murine NASH model, O@PLGA@M exhibited excellent biosafety and multifaceted anti-NASH efficacy, including anti-steatosis, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic effects. Mechanistically, O@PLGA@M reprogrammed macrophages by modulating macrophage polarization and inhibiting recruitment of immune cells to reduce the inflammatory cascade. They also exerted hepatoprotection effects by reducing steatosis and hepatocyte damage. Moreover, O@PLGA@M modulated the gut microbiome by redirecting it towards a beneficial state, which further relieved NASH through the gut-liver axis.

Despite advances in anti-fibrotic therapies, existing treatments primarily slow disease progression rather than directly targeting extracellular matrix (ECM)-secreting myofibroblasts, and cannot reverse established fibrosis. In this work, a nanoparticle-enabled, anti-fibrotic approach is demonstrated to reverse the FMT in myofibroblasts via targeting cadherin-2 (CDH2), a cell-surface maker of myofibroblasts, using melanin nanoparticles with surface-engineered CDH2 antibody (CDH2-MelNPs). Treatment with CDH2-MelNPs promotes myofibroblast-to-fibroblast transition (MFT, reversed FMT), significantly suppressing ECM deposition, proliferation, migration, and invasive behavior of myofibroblasts, while concurrently mitigating tissue contractility and stiffness, the hallmarks of fibrosis. Mechanistic studies reveal that this nanoparticle-driven MFT is regulated by the inhibition of the Rho signaling, a critical regulator of FMT. Overall, these findings propose an alternative therapeutic avenue to potentially halt or reverse a broad spectrum of fibrotic diseases.

However, its therapeutic efficacy is constrained by limited delivery methods and insufficient bioavailability of hydrogen at wound sites. Herein, we design NIR-light triggered in situ gelation platform comprising ternary polymer dots as the photocatalyst, ascorbic acid as an electron mediator, and poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) as the polymeric matrix. The blended components of ternary Pdots enable the extended light absorption and cascading energy level alignment, leading to a marked increase in hydrogen generation compared to binary Pdots. Following local injection of the mixed precursor solution at the wound site and subsequent 700 nm light exposure, the in-situ gelation of PEGDA is initiated by ascorbate free radicals, obviating the need for commercial photoinitiators. The resulting hybrid hydrogel retains water content and photocatalysts, enabling prolonged hydrogen evolution under NIR light.

Current treatments primarily involve intravitreal injections (IVT) of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents. However, such treatment often requires repeated injections, develop incomplete responses, and are associated with adverse effects. Therefore, novel therapeutic agents need to be developed that exhibit low side effects and improved therapeutic efficacy of retinal neovascularization. Herein, we develop a novel polymeric gene carrier, phenylboronic acid-modified linear polyethylenimine (LPEI-PBA) that is capable of loading plasmid expressing short hairpin RNA (pshVEGF), which self-assembles with dexamethasone sodium phosphate (DSP) via electrostatic interactions to form a polymer-based gene-drug co-delivery system (DSP/LPEI-PBA/pshVEGF, DPPV) for combined neovascularization inhibition. DSP not only exerts anti-inflammatory effects but also enhances the transfection efficiency of LPEI-PBA. DPPV demonstrated favorable anti-neovascular effects both in vitro and in vivo. In an oxygen-induced retinopathy model, a single intravitreal administration of DPPV can significantly inhibited pathological neovascularization, accompanied by the downregulation of glial activation markers glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ionized calcium-binding junction molecule 1 (IBA-1), as well as the pro-inflammatory factor interleukin-1(3 (IL-1(3), and the upregulation of the anti-inflammatory factor ARG-1.

Volumetric muscle loss (VML) severely disrupts the vascular niche and impairs the ability of MuSCs to regenerate functional skeletal muscle. Until now, it remains a great challenge to reconstruct the vascular niche for muscle regeneration. Here, we successfully developed a specific 3D induction strategy based on collagen matrix and pro-angiogenic culture system to fabricate a multifunctional human pre-vascularized microtissue (h-VM) in vitro. The h-VM featured a robust vascular network formed by endothelial cells, with pericytes and mesenchymal stem cells accompanying. Under a specific induction medium, the h-VM could differentiate into adipogenic and osteogenic tissues, indicating a strong stemness within the microtissue. Of note, the h-VM significantly boosted the myogenic differentiation of MuSCs through paracrine signaling. Transplantation of the h-VM into the volumetric muscle defect not only facilitated early vessel integration with the host vasculature but also maintained muscle structural stability and provided sustained mechanical support to the defect site. Mechanistically, the h-VM effectively induced MuSCs differentiation and myofiber formation, and M2 macrophage polarization, thereby mitigating muscle fibrosis and atrophy post-injury, ultimately achieving structural and functional angio-myogenesis. Our results highlight that the h-VM can effectively re-establish the vascular regenerative microenvironment, which presents an innovative therapeutic approach to promote functional skeletal muscle regeneration following volumetric muscle loss.","Engineering, Biomedical",Bioengineered human pre-vascularized microtissues reconstruct vascular niche and regenerative microenvironment to enhance functional skeletal muscle regeneration,,[]

Upon near-infrared (NIR) irradiation, ITCC NPs generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and heat, enabling synergistic photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT), thereby sequentially triggering immunogenic cell death (ICD), activating the cGAS-STING pathway, and promoting vascular normalization.

In this study, we developed an islet microphysiological system based on a fibrous material and microfluidic spinning. This system includes pancreatic islet-loaded microfibers prepared using controllable pneumatic valves combined with microfluidic spinning technology and a microfluidic system comprising microfibers assembled with vascular endothelial cells. The results showed that the prepared microfibers loaded a large number of monodisperse pancreatic islet clusters with good cell activity and function. Microfibers were assembled with vascular endothelial cells in a microfluidic system, providing a 3D environment that mimicked natural blood vessels and supported high-throughput cell loading. Microfibers are vascularized by endothelial cells that grow on their surfaces. The microfluidic system simulated capillary blood flow and nutrient exchange, thereby enhancing the physiological relevance of the model. We evaluated the diabetes treatment drug Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) using this system. Immunofluorescence staining, RT-qPCR, and ELISA confirmed the glucose-lowering and cardiovascular protective effects of GLP-1. This islet microphysiological system provides a novel platform for studying diabetes, screening new drugs, and promoting personalized medicine. The ability of this system to simulate physiological conditions through the synergy of biophysical and biochemical factors makes it a powerful tool for biomedical research.","Engineering, Biomedical",Engineering pancreatic islet-loaded microfibers via pneumatically-controlled microfluidic spinning for the assembly of a microphysiological system,,[]
,0,2026-01-01,ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE,"The significant features identified in a representative subset of the dataset during the learning process of an artificial intelligence model are referred to as a 'global' explanation. Three-dimensional (3D) global explanations are crucial in neuroimaging, where a complex representational space demands more than basic two-dimensional interpretations. However, current studies in the literature often lack the accuracy, comprehensibility, and 3D global explanations needed in neuroimaging and beyond. To address this gap, we developed an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) 3D-Framework capable of providing accurate, low-complexity global explanations. We evaluated the framework using various 3D deep learning models trained on a well-annotated cohort of 596 structural MRIs. The binary classification task focused on detecting the presence or absence of the paracingulate sulcus (PCS), a highly variable brain structure associated with psychosis. Our framework integrates statistical features (Shape) and XAI methods (GradCam and SHAP) with dimensionality reduction, ensuring that explanations reflect both model learning and cohort-specific variability. By combining Shape, GradCam, and SHAP, our framework reduces inter-method variability, enhancing the faithfulness and reliability of global explanations. These robust explanations facilitated the identification of critical sub-regions, including the posterior temporal and internal parietal regions, as well as the cingulate region and thalamus, suggesting potential genetic or developmental influences. For the first time, this XAI 3D-Framework leverages global explanations to uncover the broader developmental context of specific cortical features. This approach advances the fields of deep learning and neuroscience by offering insights into normative brain development and atypical trajectories linked to mental illness, paving the way for more reliable and interpretable AI applications in neuroimaging.","Engineering, Biomedical",An explainable three dimensional framework to uncover learning patterns: A unified look in variable sulci recognition,,[]
,0,2026-01-01,ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE,"Post-translational modification (PTM) site prediction is significant for a deeper understanding of biological processes and disease mechanisms. Most existing studies on predicting PTM sites focus on specific PTM types and lack universality. Additionally, few methods consider combining the advantages of sequence information, pre-trained information, and structural information. A multimodal adaptive PTM sites prediction method based on 1D Large Kernel Attention (1D-LKA) is thereby proposed, named LkaM-PTM. Specifically, LkaM-PTM fuses sequence representations from the SeqNet, pretrained representations from the PLMNet, and structural representations from the StruNet in the encoder part. Firstly, SeqNet utilizes 1D-LKA adaptively to capture cross-field information, combined with the feature reusability of DenseNet to extract local features of the sequence. Next, PLMNet captures global features from the protein language model ProtBert through a multilayer perceptron (MLP). Subsequently, StruNet compresses and reconstruct structural information of global, amino acid, and atomic granularity through a Stacked Autoencoder (SAE) to extract low-dimensional structural representations. Ultimately, the three feature sets are subsequently concatenated into a unified multimodal representation and fed into a MLP-based decoder for final PTM sites prediction. Experimental results show that LkaM-PTM outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in the accuracy of predicting PTM sites. The source code and data for LkaM-PTM are available at https://github.com/tony-soochow/LkaM-PTM.","Engineering, Biomedical",LkaM-PTM: Predicting PTM sites through multimodal protein features from capturing cross-field information,,[]
,0,2026-01-01,ULTRASONIC IMAGING,"Accurate assessment of perfusion in vital organs like the pancreas is crucial for monitoring various pathologies, particularly tumors and their growth. While tumor growth inhibition usually results in decreased vascularization, current techniques for non-invasive and cost-effective perfusion assessment lack sufficient vessel separability for pancreatic applications, hindering optimal treatment selection and monitoring. Ultrasound (US) imaging offers advantages like low cost, rapid acquisition, non-invasiveness, and non-ionizing radiation. However, speckle, patient-related and acquisition-related motion artifacts, and limitations in distinguishing contrast-enhanced blood vessels, particularly in single frames, pose significant challenges. This study presents a novel solution utilizing image analysis of US contrast agents (UCAs) to characterize vascularization. The approach involves data denoising, selection of static frames, spatio-temporal registration, and deconvolution. The post-processed images are analyzed based on temporal intensity changes and normalized to extract trends. Data from 13 patients undergoing chemotherapeutic treatment with FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine/abraxane were analyzed. Though no direct effects on vascularization are expected, the results suggest a correlation between derived vascularization trends (based on B-mode and CEUS data) and observed clinical treatment outcomes. Four patients exhibited negative slope (related to vascularization regression) aligned with clinical improvement, while six showed positive slope (related to increased vascularization) coinciding with treatment deterioration. Two patients displayed negative slopes without clinical improvement, and one patient displayed positive slope but had clinical improvement. These findings indicate the potential of this method to estimate treatment efficacy and guide personalized therapy, although the sample size is small and further investigation is warranted.

,0,2026-01-01,ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE,"Medical image segmentation annotations exhibit variations among experts due to the ambiguous boundaries of segmented objects and backgrounds in medical images. Although using multiple annotations for each image in the fully-supervised setting has been extensively studied for training deep models, obtaining a large amount of multi-annotated data is challenging due to the substantial time and manpower costs required for segmentation annotations, resulting in most images lacking any annotations. To address this, we propose Multi-annotated Semi-supervised Ensemble Networks (MSE-Nets) for learning segmentation from limited multi-annotated and abundant unannotated data. Specifically, we introduce the Network Pairwise Consistency Enhancement (NPCE) module and Multi-Network Pseudo Supervised (MNPS) module to enhance MSE-Nets for the segmentation task by considering two major factors: (1) to optimize the utilization of all accessible multi-annotated data, the NPCE separates (dis)agreement annotations of multi-annotated data at the pixel level and handles agreement and disagreement annotations in different ways; (2) to mitigate the introduction of imprecise pseudo-labels, the MNPS extends the training data by leveraging consistent pseudo-labels from unannotated data. Finally, we improve confidence calibration by averaging the predictions of base networks. Experiments on the ISIC dataset show that we reduced the demand for multi-annotated data by 97.75% and narrowed the gap with the best fully-supervised baseline to just a Jaccard index of 3.7%. Furthermore, compared to other semi-supervised methods that rely only on a single annotation or a combined fusion approach, the comprehensive experimental results on ISIC and RIGA datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method in medical image segmentation with ambiguous boundaries.","Engineering, Biomedical",Multi-annotation agreement and prediction consistency networks: Improving semi-supervised segmentation of medical images with ambiguous boundaries,,[]
,0,2026-01-01,ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE,"Multi-modal medical imaging is essential in disease diagnosis and treatment planning, as it provides complementary anatomical and pathological information. However, the limitations of scan time, image corruption, and differences in imaging protocols often result in certain modalities being missing or unavailable, severely limiting the application of multi-modal data. Although existing medical image synthesis methods have made notable progress, it remains challenging to synergistically extract local details and global contextual information from multi-modal inputs, as well as to effectively fuse complementary features across modalities. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel dual-branch wavelet encoding and deformable feature interaction generative adversarial network (DWFI-GAN), for synthesizing missing modalities from available ones. Specifically, in the generator, we design a dual-branch wavelet encoder and introduce a wavelet multi-scale downsampling (Wavelet-MS-Down) module, in order to efficiently extract multi-scale local features and global contextual information at the downsampling stage. To better fuse information across modalities, we design the deformable cross-attention feature fusion (DCFF) module to interactively fuse features from different source images at multiple scales. Additionally, at the bottleneck of the generator, we design an episodic bottleneck structure. This structure employs intermittent injection of frequency-space enhanced (FSE) modules, which enriches the scale diversity of the fusion features from both frequency and spatial domain perspectives. Experiments on two medical imaging datasets show that DWFI-GAN outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative comparisons, with ablation studies further validating each module's contribution to fusion and detail enhancement.

,0,2026-01-01,ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE,"Accurate identification of Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms from biomedical text is crucial for disease diagnosis and analysis. However, traditional named entity recognition (NER) methods often fall short by overlooking synonyms and entity variants, resulting in reduced accuracy and coverage. To address these limitations, we introduce three strategic enhancements to improve HPO concept recognition. The first strategy augments the training data by incorporating HPO synonyms at the instance level, which enhances the model's ability to recognize diverse phenotypic expressions. The second strategy introduces HPOBERT, a semantic approach that models HPO synonyms through self-aligned pretraining. This method closely aligns synonym representations while effectively distinguishing them from non-synonyms, thereby improving the model's ability to differentiate between concepts. The third strategy integrates both the instance level and semantic approach. We evaluated these enhancement strategies on four clinical text datasets annotated with HPO concepts. The results demonstrate significant improvements in classification accuracy, recall, and both micro and macro F1 scores. Additionally, our enhancement strategies showed strong performance in Named Entity Normalization (NEN) after NER, accurately linking recognized HPO concepts to standardized knowledge bases. Specifically, we observe improvements of 2.44% and 4.38% in NEN-F on the gold and silver standard datasets, respectively, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

By incorporating technology-task fit and self-determination theory, this study developed a conceptual model through which to identify and observe the effects of medical AI automation and augmentation on the psychological needs (i.e., autonomy, relatedness, and competence), technology-task fit, and AI usage intention of medical staff. Using cross-sectional data from 400 Chinese medical staff, a partial least squares structural equation model (PLS-SEM) analysis showed that medical AI automation correlated positively with perceived autonomy and competence, while augmentation correlated positively with perceived autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Mediation analysis indicated that perceived autonomy, competence, and technology-task fit were sequential mediators in the association between medical AI automation and usage intention; perceived autonomy, competence, relatedness, and technology-task fit were sequential mediators in the link between medical AI augmentation and usage intention. These findings exemplify the automation-augmentation paradox in AI research, offering insight into the AI usage intention of medical staff and the underlying psychological mechanisms involved.

Methods: A multicenter computed tomography (CT) imaging dataset, including 1226 patients with stage IA lung adenocarcinoma from Datasets 1-3, was analyzed. The cohort was randomly divided into a training set (n = 858, 70%) and a test set (n = 368, 30%). Additionally, an independent external validation set, Dataset 4 (n = 266), was employed to evaluate the model's generalizability rigorously.

DHSs are crucial for understanding transcriptional regulation mechanisms and contain genetic variations linked to various diseases such as breast cancer, coronary artery disease, Alzheimer's disease, autoimmune disorders, and neurological conditions. However, conventional DHSs identification methods are labor-intensive and resource-heavy, necessitating the need for alternative cost-effective approaches with high performance. Methods: In this study, we propose various computational models, namely the CNN model, the CNN-GRU fusion model, the CNN-kmer fusion model, and the CNN-GRU-kmer fusion model, to overcome the challenges associated with DHSs prediction.

However, during clinical auscultation, LS are often contaminated by heart sounds (HS) and other noises, significantly compromising the accuracy of pathological assessment. The primary challenge lies in the spectral overlap between LS and HS, coupled with the non-stationary nature of both signals. Furthermore, abnormal LS exhibit intricate frequency components and ambiguous band boundaries, causing conventional separation methods to yield incomplete or contaminated results, which hinders precise diagnosis. Methods: To overcome these challenges, we propose a Guided-Improve Hippopotamus Optimization based Variational Mode Decomposition (GIHO-VMD) algorithm for LS separation. Specifically, a VMD model is first established with Fuzzy Entropy (FE) as the objective function. Critically, a novel complexity constraint is incorporated into this model to effectively restrict decomposition outcomes. The Hippopotamus Optimization (HO) algorithm is then employed to iteratively optimize the VMD parameters based on this objective function. To prevent the optimization from converging to local optima, a Disruption Operator (DO) is integrated into HO. Subsequently, a Guided Learning Strategy (GLS) is introduced to enhance the guiding influence of superior agents during iteration, thereby improving convergence accuracy. Finally, a dual-process dynamic threshold mechanism is implemented within GLS to moderate the frequency of guidance, thereby stabilizing the exploration-exploitation balance throughout the optimization process. Results: To evaluate the proposed method, we apply it to separate pre-simulated mixed signals of HS and LS. The SNR and NCC between the separated LS and the original ones are evaluated. Experimental results indicate that the method achieves an average SNR of 30.27 dB for normal lung sounds and an average SNR ranging from 28.60 dB to 30.11 dB for abnormal lung sounds, with an average NCC of 63.15%.

Clinical standard for seizure diagnosis and detection requires electroencephalography and video monitoring, which is yet considered not suitable for home use, especially during nighttime sleep in a low-light condition. We proposed a deep learning (DL)-based approach to automatically detect nocturnal major seizures using a wearable armband that can potentially help reduce SUDEP risk through timely caregiver intervention. Methods In this prospective cohort study, 68 patients with major seizures were monitored for up to three months using a wearable armband (NightWatch (R)) capturing tri-axial accelerometry (ACM) and photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. A two-step approach was designed: (1) a pre-screening step using threshold-based algorithms to identify suspected seizure events (ACM standard deviation >0.4 or heart rate increase >10%), and (2) a DL model (CNN-LSTM with attention mechanism) to recognize true seizures. Model performance was evaluated via a 10-fold cross-validation, reporting sensitivity (SEN), false alarm rate (FAR), and area under the ROC curve (AUC). Results In 788 overnight recordings (6304 hours), a total of 1846 severe seizures were identified. The pre-screening step achieved 0.940 sensitivity in pre-identifying or 'preserving' seizures, reducing data volume by 81% (from 6304 to 1201 hours). The DL model demonstrated a mean accuracy of 0.793 [95% CI: 0.745-0.841], a mean sensitivity of 0.762 [95% CI: 0.704-0.821], a mean positive predictive value of 0.334 [95% CI: 0.229-0.356] and a mean false alarm rate of 0.165/hour [95% CI: 0.097-0.234].

However, existing research has primarily focused on characterizing macroscopic rheological behavior, with limited systematic analysis of the dynamic response mechanisms of microscopic hydrogen bond networks during shear deformation. To better explain the shear thinning properties of hyaluronic acid solutions at the microscopic level, this study employed molecular dynamics simulation methods and abstracted the rotational shear from macro-scale rheological experiments into linear shear. Methods: A system composed of hyaluronic acid molecules and water molecules was used to simulate the conformational evolution of hyaluronic acid solutions under different shear rates. This study analyzed the number of hydrogen bonds formed between hyaluronic acid molecules and water molecules, hydrogen bond lengths, as well as hydrogen bond angles. Additionally, these findings were combined with macroscopic rheological experiments. Results: The number of hydrogen bonds formed between hyaluronic acid molecules and water molecules decreased under shear stress. Furthermore, the hydrogen bond lengths increased, and the hydrogen bond angles decreased, resulting in an overall weakening of hydrogen bond strength. Conclusions: The loss of hydrogen bond strength directly reduces fluid resistance and enhances solution flowability, which is consistent with the shear thinning characteristics observed in macroscopic rheological experiments.","Engineering, Biomedical",Molecular dynamics deconstruction of hyaluronic acid shear thinning: hydrogen bond network dynamics driving rheological response,,[]

Traditional methods often lack the flexibility to assess complex dependencies or to evaluate covariate effects in a nonparametric manner. Moreover, there is a growing need for computationally efficient tools that integrate hypothesis testing and model diagnostics within the framework of long-term survival and cure probability estimation. Methods: We present a comprehensive R package that implements both novel and existing methods across three key areas: dependency analysis, nonparametric hypothesis testing in cure models, and goodness-of-fit testing for the cure rate in mixture cure models. For dependency analysis, we include functions based on martingale difference correlation and divergence to assess covariate effects on the conditional mean. To test the significance of covariates on cure probability, we propose a nonparametric framework comprising four approaches, three based on martingale difference correlation and one based on L2 distance. An extended version of the test also allows for adjustment by a second covariate. For model checking, we introduce the goft() function for analytical goodness-of-fit testing and plotCure() for visual comparison of parametric and nonparametric cure probability estimates under logit, probit, and cloglog link functions. Results: The proposed methods showed a good performance in both simulated and real-world datasets. Martingale-based dependency measures effectively identified covariates influencing the conditional mean, while the nonparametric tests accurately detected covariate effects on cure probability. The extended test enhanced interpretability in multivariable settings. Goodness-of-fit analyses confirmed that the proposed tools correctly identified appropriate link functions, with visual outputs from plotCure() closely matching analytical results from goft().

However, traditional screening methods that rely on laboratory-based analyses face significant challenges in enabling timely and continuous monitoring. This study addresses these limitations by introducing a non-invasive approach for albuminuria risk detection, allowing real-time estimation of mild albuminuria increases using vital signs and body measurements. Methods: We developed a non-invasive model for albuminuria risk detection using vital signs and body measurements. Data were drawn from the NHANES cohort (USA) and a Bangladeshi cohort of people with diabetes (PwD). Feature selection identified four non-laboratory predictors - estimated cardiac output (eCO), body mass index, waist circumference, and diabetes duration - as the most informative inputs. The proposed models were benchmarked against baseline machine learning approaches and existing methods developed over the past decade, with model interpretability assessed via SHapely Additive exPlanation (SHAP) contributions. Results: Our best model, an XGBoost classifier, achieved an AUC of 0.75 [0.67-0.84], an accuracy of 0.70, and a macro F1 score of 0.68, outperforming other non-invasive risk scores (0.58) and machine learning baselines. Validation against an external reference risk score confirmed superior precision-recall balance for both positive (microalbuminuria) and negative classes. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that a fine-tuned, non-invasive XGBoost model using simple clinical measures can support albuminuria monitoring and early DKD detection without laboratory tests. While the selected predictors may not represent the definitive or optimal feature set, their strong performance highlights the potential of leveraging easily obtainable, clinically relevant measures. In particular, the contribution of eCO underscores a promising direction for exploring heart-kidney-metabolism interactions in DKD risk assessment. Together, these findings highlight a scalable, non-invasive tool for resource-limited settings, an interpretable framework for clinical trust, and a pathway to refining feature sets for both accuracy and biological insight.","Engineering, Biomedical",Refine XGBoost with SHAP explainability for non-invasive early detection of diabetic kidney disease: Estimated cardiac output as a potential indicator,,[]

Non-invasive magnetic resonance urography (MRU) can utilize the water in the urine as a natural contrast agent to image renal pelvis and calyces, which could be used to diagnose UPJO. However, as invasive techniques, MRU fails to provide detailed definitive measurements, such as pressure and velocity. This study aims to provide a non-invasive method to compute urine flow dynamics based on deep learning and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques. The method could gain insights into the urodynamic characteristics of hydronephrosis patients, which facilitates clinical decision-making and further contributes to prognosis. Methods: This work proposed a method to characterize urine flow dynamics with MRU data. Specifically, the method first reconstructs patient-specific three-dimensional renal pelvis mesh models with deep learning techniques. Then, boundary conditions were set according to the mesh models, and the Viscous k-epsilon turbulence model was used to perform CFD simulation of urine. Finally, the method characterizes the dynamics of urinary flows for UPJO diagnosis and prognosis. Results: Experiments are conducted on MRU data via our proposed method. By comparing the preoperative and postoperative urine pressure cloud maps of patients, we found that the pressure in the renal pelvis was significantly lower in the postoperative period than in the preoperative period. Furthermore, we introduced the urine flow velocity ratio (UFVR) index to assess the obstruction of urine in renal pelvis. We compared the UFVR in the preoperative and postoperative phase, and indicated that the obstruction of urine flow has been mitigated following surgery. Conclusions: CFD can simulate the urinary flow field within the renal pelvis, offering the possibility of predicting renal pelvic pressure without the need for painful, invasive interventions such as the Whitaker test.

To address the issues faced in existing research, such as distorted grids, cutting with volume loss, low computational efficiency, and surgical tool penetration, this paper proposes a parallel data structure optimized for GPU computation. This structure enables efficient cutting with minimal volume loss and provides force feedback effects without model penetration. Methods: This paper applies the Dual Contouring algorithm within the deformable grid framework for realtime mesh reconstruction, which can be divided into surface reconstruction during deformation and cutting surface reconstruction. By precomputing all possible voxel grid connections and the calculation methods for the feature points of each mesh, feature point positions can be quickly determined within a single GPU thread, accelerating the reconstruction process. Additionally, the force feedback algorithm based on Signed Distance Field and the Finger-proxy model addresses the penetration issue when the surgical tool collides with soft tissue. Results: Simulation results show that, compared to traditional mesh cutting methods, the proposed approach retains the non-manifold surface features at the cut areas during real-time cutting, and the frame rate does not decrease as the number of cuts increases. The use of the Signed Distance Field for collision detection ensures that the tool has both collision volume and force feedback effects.

,0,2026-01-01,COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE,"Background The use of generic waveforms as inlet boundary conditions (BCs) in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of the aorta greatly expands the applicability of CFD beyond the limited number of cases with patient-specific 4D MRI datasets. However, the validity of this approach has not been fully investigated. Methods This study evaluates the sensitivity of five hemodynamic indices in the thoracic aorta-time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS), oscillatory shear index (OSI), relative residence time (RRT), cross-flow index (CFI), and normalized topological shear variation index (normalized_TSVI)-to the choice of inlet BC. Simulations are performed for six patients with aortic root aneurysms using four different inlet conditions: spatiotemporal 4D MRI data (S1), patient-specific flow waveforms (S2), and two modified generic waveforms (S3 and S4), with S3 statistically derived and S4 extracted from a single patient. Hemodynamic metrics are analyzed at nodal resolution and through circumferential averaging at 5 mm intervals along the aorta. Results Accurate simulation in the ascending aorta (AA) requires full spatial and temporal inlet resolution (errors: >100% nodal, >40% circumferential). In contrast, the descending aorta (DA) shows lower sensitivity to inlet BCs. In the absence of 4D MRI data, S2 is the most reliable surrogate. Among the generic waveforms, the statistically derived S3 consistently outperforms S4 in the DA. With S3, TAWSS and OSI remain within 25% of 4D MRI values, both nodally and circumferentially. RRT shows moderate sensitivity: regional values are acceptable, but nodal and circumferential errors exceed 100% and 30%, particularly in the proximal DA. CFI and normalized TSVI are highly sensitive to inlet conditions and remain unreliable without 4D MRI data. Conclusion Full spatiotemporal inlet resolution is essential for accurate CFD simulations in the AA. In the DA, statistically derived generic waveforms such as S3 provide practical alternatives for evaluating robust metrics like TAWSS and OSI. However, sensitive indices such as RRT, CFI, and TSVI still necessitate patient-specific data. We recommend developing S3-like waveforms using larger datasets to further improve the accuracy and clinical utility of CFD in the absence of 4D MRI data.","Engineering, Biomedical","In silico assessment of aortic hemodynamic sensitivity to inlet boundary conditions: Comparative analysis of 4D MRI, patient-specific, and modified generic waveforms",,[]

Methods: 73 hematoxylin and eosin-stained (H&E) whole slide images (WSIs) of osteosarcoma specimens were analyzed. Tumor regions were segmented using weakly supervised learning, followed by extraction of 215 nuclear features including shape, texture, spatial and topological features through the Hover-Net network. Feature selection was performed using five methods: least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), mutual information (MI), recursive feature elimination (RFE), Wilcoxon rank sum test (WRST), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), with the top 5 features selected from each method. These features were subsequently integrated with 8 machine learning classifiers: adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), balanced random forest (BalancedRF), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), multilayer perceptron (MLP), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) to determine the optimal hybrid model. Results: By combining 5 key features with 8 machine learning classifiers, we selected the optimal hybrid model (XGBoost+SVM).

RNA modifications play critical roles in regulating various biological functions in cancers. However, the involvement of RNA modification-related pseudouridine synthase (PUS) genes in hepatocellular carcinoma remains unclear. Methods: To explore the diagnostic and prognostic significance of PUS genes in hepatocellular carcinoma, we analysed the transcriptomic and clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Differential analysis and ROC analysis were conducted to evaluate the diagnostic potential of PUS genes. Protein expression levels of PUS1 and PUS7 were examined using The Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database, and the overexpression of PUS7 was further validated by immunohistochemistry staining. Univariate and multivariate COX regression analyses were performed to analyze the prognostic value of PUS7. Nomograms were built based on COX regression analytic results to predict patient survival. The tumor immune microenvironment was characterized using TIMER2.0, EPIC, and xCell algorithms to estimate the immune cell infiltration. Results: The results showed that PUS7 mRNA and protein levels are significantly over-expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues compared to normal tissues. PUS7 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and may serve as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in hepatocellular carcinoma. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that PUS7 is involved in key oncogenic pathways, including cell cycle, DNA replication, homologous recombination, oocyte meiosis, mismatch repair, and spliceosome signaling pathways. Immune microenvironment analysis revealed a significant correlation between PUS7 expression and immune cell infiltration in hepatocellular carcinoma, suggesting a potential role in modulating tumor immunity.

Conventional clustering and linear dimensionality reduction methods often fail to handle noise effectively or provide interpretability, while standard non-negative matrix factorization approaches are too shallow to capture non-linear patterns. Multi-view non-negative matrix factorization enables integration of complementary views, but it remains primarily unsupervised and seldom leverages available label information. Methods: We propose SSD-MO, a Semi-Supervised Deep Non-Negative Matrix Factorization model for Multi-Omics Data, designed to address these challenges by leveraging both labelled and unlabelled samples for enhanced data integration and clustering performance. SSD-MO combines semi-supervised learning with a multi-layer deep factorization framework, preserving local geometric structure and incorporating orthogonal and diversity constraints. Its effectiveness was validated on six multi-omics datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas, using evaluation metrics such as clustering accuracy, normalized mutual information, and F-scores.

Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters can prevent emboli from reaching the pulmonary vasculature, yet they often become occluded, compromising long-term efficacy. Methods: To address this, we developed a novel swirling flow diverter and evaluated its performance using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in both idealized and patient-specific IVC models, alongside in vitro experiments in a glass-based perfusion system. Key hemodynamic parameters were assessed under varying geometric conditions (pitch, diameter, taper, and placement distance). Results: CFD simulations showed that the helical diverter effectively induces swirling flow, enhancing wall shear stress and accelerating thrombus clearance on the filter. Both idealized and patient-specific models exhibited reduced thrombus retention compared with standard diverters. In vitro experiments supported these findings, revealing decreased flow residence time and lower residual thrombus volume. Conclusions: Collectively, these observations underscore the importance of systematically optimizing diverter geometry to fully harness the benefits of swirling flow for IVCF applications.

In this study, we focus on diagnosing autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and alzheimer's disease (AD) by analyzing functional brain networks (FBNs), which are represented as graphs capturing the functional connectivity patterns of the brain. The primary challenges in modeling FBNs for this disorder stem from two key issues: (i) the heterogeneity among graphs, and (ii) the disease-unrelated information within graphs. Method: We introduce a two-stage framework, BrainOSM, which combines outlier screening in datasets with a multi-view graph pooling module for enhanced graph classification. Specifically, the first stage employs progressive uncertainty-based outlier screening to reduce the interference of inter-graph heterogeneity. The second stage integrates multi-graph pooling, multi-view learning, and prior subnetwork regularization to refine graph structures, effectively tackling the challenge of disease-unrelated information within graphs. Results: To validate the effectiveness of our method, we assess its performance on two public datasets: the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) dataset and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. On the ABIDE dataset, BrainOSM achieved an average accuracy of 70.23% and an AUC of 70.42%, corresponding to improvements of 8.55% and 7.74% over the traditional GCN method.

In contrast, the Phonocardiography (PCG) provides a more affordable alternative via capturing heart sound signals using a stethoscope. However, PCG analysis is often compromised by environmental noise. Most existing methods address this issue with denoising techniques, which can inadvertently suppress vital heart sound components. To address this challenge, the objective of this work is to develop a computationally efficient and noise-resilient method for PCG classification.

Methods: The governing non-dimensionalized, nonlinear partial differential equations along with the boundary conditions are transformed in the radial coordinate to regularize the irregular arterial boundaries. The resulting system of equations is then solved numerically using the forward time-centered space (FTCS) finite difference technique, which offers an efficient and robust framework for handling complex flow geometries and evaluation of flow variables. Results: In view of the real-life applications of the present model, the authors have analyzed the impact of various emerging parameters such as radiation parameter, Jeffery fluid parameter, Hall parameter, magnetic number, etc. on the various flow variables like wall shear stress, flow rate, impedance, Nusselt number, Sherwood number, microorganisms, concentration, temperature and velocity. The results of the present model indicate that the velocity increases by 27.24% and 25.24% on increasing Jeffery fluid parameter for parent and daughter artery respectively. Moreover, the temperature of the fluid with increased Hall parameter values falls by 6.63% and 4.07% for parent and daughter artery, respectively. Through the present model, it was found that the entropy generation number rises with increasing radiation parameter and magnetic number in both parent and daughter arteries. Conclusion: The outcomes of the present research can be utilized for the therapeutic possibilities of drug delivery management through complex diseased arterial networks.

In the biomedical domain, such as neuroimaging for Multiple Sclerosis (MS), counterfactual reasoning has the potential to enhance understanding of disease mechanisms and treatment effects. However, generating anatomically plausible counterfactuals that generalize well to unseen data remains a major challenge. Methods: We propose an optimization-based adversarial framework for generating realistic counterfactual trajectories of cortical grey matter (GM) thickness in MS patients. The method uses the gradients of a pre-trained MS classifier to guide the generation process towards a desired disease state while enforcing anatomical constraints and disentangling disease-relevant signals from confounding factors such as age and sex. Results: Our approach successfully produces plausible counterfactual GM thickness maps that reflect known anatomical patterns of MS progression. The generated trajectories maintain consistency with biological structure and improve interpretability of model decisions.

However, the development of such models is hindered by the limited availability of ICT-related data. This study aimed to develop an accurate prediction model for immunotherapy response in GC patients using data augmentation and active learning techniques. Methods: We utilized a generative adversarial network (GAN) to augment current experimental data from 78 GC patients treated with anti-programmed death (anti-PD-1) therapy. We then introduced an active learning (AL) framework to select the most informative samples, minimizing redundant information and mitigating overfitting. Multiple machine learning algorithms were evaluated, with the Random Forest (RF) classifier identified as the optimal model. Its performance was validated on an independent cohort generated by the Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) algorithm. Important genes and therapeutic agents were explored using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) and drug-gene correlation analyses.

Previous studies have shown that CD is a distributed brain network disorder, but the specific brain regions underlying these abnormalities remain poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to identify aberrant brain regions associated with CD through a data-driven approach. Methods: EEG signals were recorded from 16 CD patients and 15 healthy controls (HC). These signals were mapped from the scalp to the cerebral cortex using source localization techniques. Functional connectivity (FC) across five frequency bands was quantified using the weighted phase lag index (wPLI). Network topology was then analyzed using Network-Based Statistics (NBS) and graph theoretical metrics, with correlations made to clinical severity scores. Results: Compared to HC, patients with CD showed widespread brain network alterations across multiple frequency bands. In the alpha frequency band, the FC of CD patients decreased, which may be related to impaired motor control function. Conversely, in the (3 and low gamma frequency range, FC was increased in CD patients, suggesting abnormalities in sensory processing and cortical inhibitory function. Notably, the node strength of caudate nucleus may serve as a biomarker for assessing the severity of CD. Additionally, a unique modular structure involving the thalamus and sensorimotor cortex was identified in the (3 frequency band of CD patients, suggesting abnormal sensory-motor integration circuits.

While state-of-the-art graph-based reconstruction methods have shown promise in addressing this challenge by leveraging non-local and non-linear correlations in MRF data, they often face two critical limitations: high computational costs associated with large-scale graph structure estimation and limited capacity to capture complex spatiotemporal dynamics. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes an anatomical structure-guided joint spatiotemporal graph embedding framework for MRF reconstruction. By integrating anatomical segmentation and homogeneity clustering, our framework partitions MRF data into spatially contiguous regions and groups them into clusters based on tissue homogeneity. Subgraphs are then constructed for each cluster, capturing non-local spatial correlations while preserving fine-grained temporal signal dynamics. The hierarchical graph embedding architecture enables efficient focusing on critical correlations, significantly improving reconstruction performance and reducing computational complexity. Numerical experiments on both simulated and in vivo MRF datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a similar to 2 dB higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in reconstructed data and a similar to 70% reduction in reconstruction time.

,0,2026-01-01,MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS,"Positron emission tomography (PET) image denoising, along with lesion and organ segmentation, are critical steps in PET-aided diagnosis. However, existing methods typically treat these tasks independently, overlooking inherent synergies between them as correlated steps in the analysis pipeline. In this work, we present the anatomically and metabolically informed diffusion (AMDiff) model, a unified framework for denoising and lesion/organ segmentation in low-count PET imaging. By integrating multi-task functionality and exploiting the mutual benefits of these tasks, AMDiff enables direct quantification of clinical metrics, such as total lesion glycolysis (TLG), from low-count inputs. The AMDiff model incorporates a semantic-informed denoiser based on diffusion strategy and a denoising-informed segmenter utilizing nnMamba architecture. The segmenter constrains denoised outputs via a lesion-organ-specific regularizer, while the denoiser enhances the segmenter by providing enriched image information through a denoising revision module. These components are connected via a warming-up mechanism to optimize multi-task interactions. Experiments on multi-vendor, multi-center, and multi-noise-level datasets demonstrate the superior performance of AMDiff. For test cases below 20% of the clinical count levels from participating sites, AMDiff achieves TLG quantification biases of-21.60 +/- 47.26%, outperforming its ablated versions which yield biases of-30.83 +/- 59.11% (without the lesion-organ-specific regularizer) and-35.63 +/- 54.08% (without the denoising revision module). By leveraging its internal multi-task synergies, AMDiff surpasses standalone PET denoising and segmentation methods. Compared to the benchmark denoising diffusion model, AMDiff reduces the normalized root-mean-square error for lesion/liver by 22.92/17.27% on average. Compared to the benchmark nnMamba segmentation model, AMDiff improves lesion/liver Dice coefficients by 10.17/2.02% on average.","Engineering, Biomedical",Anatomically and metabolically informed diffusion for unified denoising and segmentation in low-count PET imaging,,[]

Previous postmortem studies have demonstrated the potential of submillimeter dMRI in enabling more precise delineations of curved and crossing white matter pathways. However, achieving such resolution in-vivo poses significant challenges due to the intrinsically low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Furthermore, for echo-planar imaging (EPI), large matrix sizes often require long echo spacing, readout duration, and echo times (TE), leading to significant image distortion, T2* blurring, and T2 signal decay. Here, we propose an acquisition and reconstruction framework to overcome these challenges. Based on numerical simulations, we employ in-plane segmented 3D multi-slab EPI that leverages the optimal SNR efficiency of 3D multi-slab imaging while reducing echo spacing, readout durations, and TE using in-plane segmentation. This approach minimizes distortion, improves image sharpness, and enhances SNR. Additionally, we develop a denoiser-regularized reconstruction to suppress noise while maintaining data fidelity, which reconstructs high-SNR images without introducing substantial blurring or bias. At 3T, we present 0.53-0.65 mm in-vivo data that reveal finer fiber architectures, reduced gyral bias, and improved U-fiber mapping compared to 1.22 mm data. At 7T, we acquire 0.61 mm data that show excellent agreement with high-resolution post-mortem dMRI, demonstrating robustness and high SNR at an ultra-high field. Our method is implemented using the open-source, scanner-agnostic framework Pulseq to facilitate broader adoption across scanner platforms to benefit a wider range of applications.

Leveraging multimodal data for survival analysis has become a prominent research topic. However, the heterogeneity of data poses significant challenges to multimodal integration. While existing methods consider interactions among features from different modalities, the heterogeneity of feature spaces often hinders performance in survival analysis. In this paper, we propose a hybrid supervised framework for survival analysis (HSFSurv) based on multimodal feature decomposition. This framework utilizes a multimodal feature decomposition module to partition features into highly correlated and modality-specific components, facilitating targeted feature fusion in subsequent steps. To alleviate feature space heterogeneity, we design an individual-level uncertainty minimization (UMI) module to ensure consistency in prediction outcomes. Additionally, we develop a feature-level multimodal cohort contrastive learning (MCF) module to enforce consistency across features. Moreover, a probabilistic decay detection module with a supervisory signal is introduced to guide the contrastive learning process. These modules are jointly trained to project multimodal features into a shared latent vector space. Finally, we finetune the framework for survival analysis tasks to achieve prognostic predictions.

To address this challenge, we propose Fair Re-fusion After Disentanglement (FairREAD), a novel, simple, and efficient framework that mitigates unfairness by re-integrating sensitive demographic attributes into fair image representations. FairREAD employs orthogonality constraints and adversarial training to disentangle demographic information while using a controlled re-fusion mechanism to preserve clinically relevant details.

To address these issues, we propose a robust NAS with progressive-enhanced strategies for FBN classification. Specifically, this method adopts Particle Swarm Optimization as the search method, while treating candidate architectures as individuals, and proposes two progressive-enhanced (PE) strategies to optimize the critical stages of population sampling and fitness evaluation. In the population sampling stage, we first utilize Latin Hypercube Sampling to initialize a small-scale population, ensuring a broad search range. Subsequently, to reduce random fluctuations in searches, we propose a PE supplementary sampling strategy that identifies advantageous regions of the solution space, and performs precise supplementary sampling of the population. In the fitness evaluation stage, to enhance the noise resistance of the searched architectures, we propose a PE fitness evaluation strategy.

Accurate CBF quantification under microgravity conditions is fundamental for maintaining astronaut health and ensuring the success of human space missions. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is currently the only non-invasive, non-radioactive technique to quantitatively assessing global and regional CBF. However, deploying MRI scanners aboard space station remains challenging due to technical, logistical and payload limitations. To address this challenge, we propose an end-toend Anatomy-guided Generative Adversarial Network (AgGAN) as non-invasive, cost-effective, and accurate tool for estimating CBF by synthesizing ASL images under simulated microgravity conditions from corresponding baseline images.

Among various methods based on rs-fMRI, graph neural networks have received significant attention because of their inherent structural similarity to functional connectivity networks (FCNs) of the brain. However, constructing FCNs that effectively capture both spatial and temporal information from rs-fMRI remains challenging, as traditional methods often rely on static, fully connected graphs that risk redundancy and neglect dynamic patterns.

Semi-supervised segmentation is a solution for learning from labeled and unlabeled data, which mainly focuses on generating pseudo annotations for unlabeled data or learning consistent features in enhanced views of images to enhance model generalization. However, anatomically, diverse learning difficulties across tissues are overlooked, and, technically, the estimation and minimization of empirical risk for unlabeled training data are largely ignored. Motivated by them, this work proposes a semi-supervised segmentation model, named CSUDRM, with two modules.

Moreover, it enhances feature space intra-class compactness and inter-class discrepancy and provides category-specific penalties for more robust learning. The latter one is Unlabeled Data Risk Minimization (UDRM). It minimizes the risk on the entire training data, which distinguishes it from most existing works that merely optimize labels.

However, previous methods may miss disease-related lowamplitude activations, since it is challenging to determine if a low-amplitude voxel is signal or noise during the iterative update process based solely on magnitude or phase sparsity. To this end, we propose a novel sparse decomposition model with collaborative phase and magnitude sparsity constraints at the voxel level. Specifically, we impose a sparsity constraint on the product of the magnitude and phase of a voxel above a pre-defined phase threshold. The low-amplitude activations with larger phase changes can survive the update process, despite temporarily violating the small-phase-change characteristic of signal voxels. Moreover, we eliminate phase ambiguity during iterations by proving no additional phase change is introduced by the update rules and by initializing the dictionary matrix atoms using the observed time series with fixed phase angles. We evaluate the proposed method using complex-valued simulated data and experimental resting-state fMRI data from schizophrenia patients and healthy controls.

To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel method to hierarchically segment the fetal brain into 87 distinct regions. The method employs a three-level coarse-to-fine network with the coarse level providing prior information to aid the fine level for fine segmentation. The first level predicts 8 brain regions, the second level refines the first-level 8 brain regions into 36 regions, and the final level refines further into 87 regions.

Therefore, it is crucial to assess the vulnerability of FL models to such attacks because privacy breaches may discourage data sharing, potentially impacting the models' generalizability and clinical relevance. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel framework to evaluate the vulnerability of federated deep learning models trained using retinal images to gradient inversion attacks. Importantly, we demonstrate how publicly available data can be used to enhance the quality of reconstructed images through an innovative image-to-image translation technique. The effectiveness of the proposed method was measured by evaluating the similarity between real fundus images and the corresponding reconstructed images using three different convolutional neural network architectures: ResNet-18, VGG-16, and DenseNet-121. Experimental results for the task of retinal age prediction demonstrate that, across all models, over 92 % of the participants in the training set could be identified from their reconstructed retinal vessel structure alone. Furthermore, even with the implementation of differential privacy countermeasures, we show that substantial information can still be extracted from the reconstructed images. Therefore, this work underscores the urgent need for improved defensive strategies to safeguard patient privacy during federated learning.","Engineering, Biomedical",A novel gradient inversion attack framework to investigate privacy vulnerabilities during retinal image-based federated learning,,[]

More are in CT and ultrasound and fewer utilize MRI despite unique diagnostic advantages. The obstacles lie in dataset curation, technical complexity, and clinical explainability in liver MRI. In this paper, we propose the Correlation Routing Network (CRN) which takes in 10 MRI sequences and predicts lesion types (HCC, Cholangioma, Metastasis, Hemangioma, FNH, Cyst) as well as imaging features, to achieve both high accuracy and explainability. The CRN model consists of encoding branches, correlation routing/relay modules, and the self-attention module. The independent encoding paradigm facilitates information disentangling, the correlation routing scheme helps redirection and decoupling effectively, and the self-attention enforces global feature sharing and prediction consistency. The model predicts detailed lesion imaging features, promoting explainable classification and clinical accountability. We also identify the signal relations and derive quantitative explainability. Our liver lesion classification model achieves malignant-benign accuracy of 97.2%, six-class accuracy of 88%, and averaged imaging feature accuracy of 84.9%, outperforming popular CNN and transformer-based models.

DG methods try to achieve this by learning domain-invariant features that are robust to variations across different domains. This work proposes a novel domain generalization (DG) technique termed Adversarial Intensity Attack (AdverIN). AdverIN leverages an adversarial training strategy to augment data diversity by synthesizing a spectrum of intensity variations while preserving essential contextual information within images. We evaluated AdverIN through rigorous experiments on diverse multi-domain tasks: 2D retinal optic disc/cup segmentation and 3D prostate MRI segmentation. Our results demonstrate that AdverIN significantly improves the generalizability of segmentation models, achieving state-of-the-art performance on these challenging datasets.

,0,2026-01-01,MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS,"For heart diagnostics, ultrasound is generally the modality of choice due to its high temporal and spatial resolution, availability, and patient safety. Although 3D echocardiography captures the complex shape and motion of the heart with more precision than 2D, it suffers to a greater extent from poor resolution, noise, and limited field-of-view. Multi-perspective echocardiography has proven to significantly enhance both image quality and field-of-view. The greatest improvements occur when combining acquisitions from widely differing insonification angles, but this process is challenging because of substantial local structural and brightness variations and ultrasound's anisotropic nature. To handle these inconsistencies, a novel temporal and spatial registration algorithm designed is proposed. Temporal registration is achieved using low-frequency cardiac wall features and motion extracted via singular value decomposition of a spatio-temporal Casorati matrix, while spatial registration is performed using phase-only correlation of low-frequency data. The acquisitions are seamlessly fused using a 3D, oriented, wavelet transform including a near-field clutter algorithm. In vitro and in vivo testing highlights the benefits of this approach. Temporal alignment, validated against electrocardiograms, is precise, with an average error of just 2 +/- 10 ms. Furthermore, our method outperforms a six-degree-of-freedom encoder-based probe tracker, reducing spatial registration error to 5 +/- 3 mm from 19 +/- 10 mm. The resulting longitudinal and radial strain measurements closely align with those obtained by tagged magnetic resonance imaging, demonstrating the accuracy and feasibility of this technique.","Engineering, Biomedical",Spatio-temporal registration of multi-perspective 3D echocardiography for improved strain estimation,,[]

Accurate segmentation of the optic cup and optic disc, along with the calculation of the cup-to-disc ratio (CDR), is central to glaucoma screening. However, traditional semantic segmentation methods face significant challenges in handling complex fundus images due to interference from background structures such as blood vessels. To address this, this paper proposes a saliency detection-inspired method for optic cup and disc segmentation, extending saliency detection to a three-class task (optic cup, optic disc, and background). The approach incorporates an Edge-guided Multi-scale Feature Extraction Module (EMFEM), a Global Context Information Enhancement Module (GCIEM), and a Self-Interaction Module (SIM) to integrate multi-level features and improve segmentation performance. Additionally, a ConvNeXtV2-based feature extraction network and improved loss functions-including Cross-Entropy Loss, Consistency-Enhanced Loss (CEL), and Edge-Gradient-Aware Tversky Loss (EAL)-are employed to optimize saliency focus and boundary refinement. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms mainstream segmentation algorithms on six public datasets. It achieves the highest Dice coefficients of 0.9073 for optic cup segmentation on the Drishti-GS dataset, and 0.9734 and 0.8965 for optic cup and disc segmentation on the Rim-One dataset, respectively.

,0,2026-01-01,MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS,"Unsupervised anomaly detection and segmentation methods train a model to learn the training distribution as 'normal'. In the testing phase, they identify patterns that deviate from this normal distribution as 'anomalies'. To learn the 'normal' distribution, prevailing methods corrupt the images and train a model to reconstruct them. During testing, the model attempts to reconstruct corrupted inputs based on the learned 'normal' distribution. Deviations from this distribution lead to high reconstruction errors, which indicate potential anomalies. However, corrupting an input image inevitably causes information loss even in normal regions, leading to suboptimal reconstruction and an increased risk of false positives. To alleviate this, we propose IterMask3D, an iterative spatial mask-refining strategy designed for 3D brain MRI. We iteratively spatially mask areas of the image as corruption and reconstruct them, then shrink the mask based on reconstruction error. This process iteratively unmasks 'normal' areas to the model, whose information further guides reconstruction of 'normal' patterns under the mask to be reconstructed accurately, reducing false positives. In addition, to achieve better reconstruction performance, we also propose using high-frequency image content as additional structural information to guide the reconstruction of the masked area. Extensive experiments on the detection of both synthetic and real-world imaging artifacts, as well as segmentation of various pathological lesions across multiple MRI sequences, consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

,0,2026-01-01,MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS,"Deformable registration of multimodal medical images constitutes a fundamental task in many medical image analysis applications, particularly in the diagnosis and treatment of liver cancer where different modality images are frequently employed. Despite the emergence of various learning-based registration models, multimodal registration remains a challenging task due to pronounced intensity differences and significant tissue deformations. To address these challenges, we approach the problem from two perspectives-mitigating modality discrepancies and enhancing the model's capacity to handle large deformations. We propose a multimodal deformable registration model based on adaptive recursive inference and representation disentanglement (ARDMR). Specifically, to enhance the model's ability to learn features from different modalities, we introduce a modality representation disentanglement method, incorporating Multi-layer Contrastive Loss (MCL) to enforce the learning of modality-invariant features. To address the challenge of large complex deformations, we propose a Multi-Scale Feature Registration module (MSFR), which integrates features and deformation fields from different scales during the registration process. Finally, to further exploit the registration potential of the trained model, we propose an adaptive recursive inference strategy. This strategy automatically determines the optimal recursive registration scale and the number of iterations based on the image's real-time registration performance. We conducted experiments on multimodal datasets collected from multiple medical centers and compared our method with several state-of-the-art registration models. The results indicate that our proposed ARDMR model outperforms others in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Specifically, compared with the baseline VoxelMorph model, ARDMR improves the DSC metric by 2.5%-5% across different datasets. Furthermore, tests on distribution-shifted data demonstrate that our model exhibits the best robustness and generalization.

,0,2026-01-01,MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS,"Medical image segmentation is critical for accurate diagnostics and effective treatment planning. Traditional multi-rater labeling strategies, while integrating consensus from multiple experts, often do not fully capture the unique insights of individual raters. Moreover, deep discriminative models that aggregate such expert labels typically embed inherent biases into the segmentation results. To address these issues, we introduce CaliDiff, a novel multi-rater annotation calibration diffusion probabilistic model. This model effectively approximates the joint probability distribution among multiple expert annotations and their corresponding images, fully leveraging diverse expert knowledge while actively refining these annotations to approximate the true underlying distribution closely. CaliDiff operates through a structured multi-stage process: it begins with a shared-parameter inverse diffusion to normalize initial expert biases, followed by Expertness Consistent Alignment to minimize variance among annotations and enhance consistency in high-confidence areas. Additionally, we incorporate a Committee-based Endogenous Knowledge Learning mechanism that uses adversarial soft supervision to simulate a reliable pseudo-ground truth, integrating Cross-Expert Fusion and Implicit Consensus Inference. Extensive experimental evaluations on various medical image segmentation datasets show that CaliDiff not only significantly improves the calibration of annotations but also achieves state-of-the-art performance, thereby enhancing the reliability and objectivity of medical diagnostics.","Engineering, Biomedical",CaliDiff: Multi-rater annotation calibrating diffusion probabilistic model towards medical image segmentation,,[]
,0,2026-01-01,MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS,"The anatomical landmarks on the liver (mesh) surface, including the falciform ligament and liver ridge, are composed of triangular meshes of varying shapes, sizes, and positions, making them highly complex. Extracting and segmenting these landmarks is critical for augmented reality-based intraoperative navigation and monitoring. The key to this task lies in comprehensively understanding the overall geometric shape and local topological information of the liver mesh. However, due to the liver's variations in shape and appearance, coupled with limited data, deep learning methods often struggle with automatic liver landmark segmentation. To address this, we propose a two-stage automatic framework combining mesh-CNN and graph-CNN. In the first stage, dynamic graph convolution (DGCNN) is employed on low-resolution meshes to achieve rapid global understanding, generating initial landmark proposals at two levels, ""dilation"" and ""erosion"", and mapping them onto the original high-resolution surface. Subsequently, a refinement network based on mesh convolution fuses these landmark proposals from edge features along the local topology of the high-resolution mesh surface, producing refined segmentation results. Additionally, we incorporate an anatomy-aware Dice loss to address resolution imbalance and better handle sparse anatomical regions. Extensive experiments on two liver datasets, both in-distribution and out-of-distribution, demonstrate that our method accurately processes liver meshes of different resolutions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Accurate CAC scoring from gated cardiac Computed Tomography (CT) relies on precise segmentation of calcification. However, the small size, irregular shape, and sparse distribution of calcification in 3D volumes present significant challenges for automated CAC assessment. Training reliable automatic segmentation models typically requires large-scale annotated datasets, yet the annotation process is resource-intensive, requiring highly trained specialists. To address this limitation, we propose S2CAC, a semi-supervised learning framework for CAC segmentation that achieves robust performance with minimal labeled data. First, we design a dual-path hybrid transformer architecture that jointly optimizes pixel-level segmentation and volume-level scoring through feature symbiosis, minimizing the information loss caused by down-sampling operations and enhancing the model's ability to preserve fine-grained calcification details. Second, we introduce a scoring-driven consistency mechanism that aligns pixel-level segmentation with volume-level CAC scores through differentiable score estimation, effectively leveraging unlabeled data. Third, we address the challenge of incorporating negative samples (cases without CAC) into training. Directly using these samples risks model collapse, as the sparse nature of CAC regions may lead the model to predict all-zero maps. To mitigate this, we design a dynamic weighted loss function that integrates negative samples into the training process while preserving the model's sensitivity to calcification. This approach effectively reduces over-segmentation and enhances overall model performance. We validate our framework on two public non-contrast gated CT datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance over previous baseline methods. Additionally, the Agatston scores derived from our segmentation maps demonstrate strong concordance with manual annotations. These results highlight the potential of our approach to reduce dependence on annotated data while maintaining high accuracy in CAC scoring.

A patient-specific structural model followed by fluid-structure interaction was developed to simulate S3 deployment and then assess post-TAVI hemodynamics in 20 patients.

EOA and TPG predictions showed reasonable agreement with echocardiographic data (errors within 10%). ECDF-based comparison demonstrated a high level of accuracy for device diameters (<= 5% area metric), whereas hemodynamic parameters exhibited slightly greater discrepancies, potentially due to clinical measurement variability.

Ultrasound offers real-time imaging, is radiation-free, and is highly portable. However, different organs exhibit varying degrees of penetrability to ultrasound, resulting in mutual occlusion between adjacent structures in an imaging plane. In contrast, CT images are cross-sectional and adjacent organs in the same imaging plane will not block each other. Leveraging the advantages of CT image, we propose a CT to ultrasound image synthesis task that addresses the limitations of ultrasound imaging technology, yielding clear ultrasound images. This achievement facilitates data enhancement of ultrasound images. To ensure the accuracy of the generated ultrasound images, we employ a generative adversarial network with an information separation mechanism to convert CT images into ultrasound modalities. Subsequently, a unidirectional cycle network is employed for ultrasound image generation. Notably, the dataset used in this context is unpaired due to the challenges of finding paired CT and ultrasound images. To preserve the organizational structure during generation, we introduce a domain loss.

Given the limited availability of transient elastography (TE), especially in resource-limited settings, we aimed to develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model to quantify hepatic steatosis using conventional ultrasound, which is widely available in most healthcare facilities.MethodsLiver ultrasonographic images and Controlled Attenuation Parameter (CAP) scores obtained from TE were collected from patients between 2017 and 2023. A predictive model was developed by integrating YOLOv8 for image classification with Principal Component Analysis and Lasso regression to estimate CAP scores from the ultrasonographic images. The dataset was randomly divided into training (80%), validation (10%), and test (10%) sets. Baseline patient characteristics and laboratory data were also incorporated to enhance model performance. The model's predictive ability was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R-2) and mean squared error (MSE).ResultsA total of 1065 images from 352 patients were included. The initial model achieved an R-2 of 0.55 and an MSE of 1004.07. Subgroup analysis revealed that the right intercostal view yielded the best performance (R-2=0.74, MSE = 637.99). After incorporating patient characteristics and laboratory data, the model's performance improved significantly (R-2=0.90, MSE = 245.79).ConclusionThe AI-assisted model showed promise for accessible and non-invasive assessment of hepatic steatosis, particularly when using the right intercostal view and supplemental clinical data.

A single artifacts suppression scheme cannot deal with the effects of multi-factor coupled on CT images. Aiming at the serious degradation of CT images caused by the coupled of scattering and beam-hardening issues, this paper proposes a Stage-wise Network cone beam CT coupled artifacts suppression method based on UNet++. First, according to the artifact characteristics of real CT images, the coupled artifacts model of beamhardening and scattering is established to obtain the projection-based coupled artifacts images. Then the constructed dataset is fed into the neural network to accomplish the feature learning. By implementing the design of Stage-wise Network and long-short connection structure of artifacts suppression and image enhancement, the details and location features of coupled artifacts are transferred, ultimately achieving industrial CT coupled artifact suppression. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in this paper, CT simulation and actual scan samples are trained and verified. The results show that: Compared with the original image, the average gradient (AG), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast to noise ratio (CNR) of the proposed method are improved by 35 %, 75 % and 59 %, respectively.","Engineering, Biomedical",Coupled artifacts correction of cone beam computed tomography based on U-Net plus plus deep learning,,[]

This study introduces a novel deep neural network model, the BRFormer, to address these challenges. The BRFormer employs an enhanced Pyramid Vision Transformer (PVTv2) as its encoder, which is capable of leveraging the multi-head attention mechanism to capture long-distance dependencies between various polyp components. A Cross-Scale Feature Optimization Module has been devised to effectively extract and utilize global contextual information, thereby enhancing the model's understanding of the shape of polyps with unclear boundaries in the colon and rectum, thereby improving segmentation accuracy. The model incorporates a Dual Decoder structure to meticulously attend to image edge details, and a Boundary-Region Fusion Module is introduced to further refine the model's perception of boundary regions. The experimental results indicate that the BRFormer outperforms current state-of-the-art models in multiple metrics, including mIoU, mDice, weighted Dice coefficient, Mean Absolute Error, Enhanced Alignment Metric, and Similarity Metric. On the Kvasir-SEG dataset, mIoU reached 0.875 and mDice reached 0.923; on the CVC-ClinicDB dataset, mIoU reached 0.903 and mDice reached 0.946.

Intraepidermal nerve fiber density examination plays an essential role to serve as a decidedly sensitive indicator of sensory nerve fiber damage pertinent to the SFN-related diseases. High-resolution immunofluorescence microscopy is a contemporary imaging technique that provides sharper visibility of the tissue structures. Segmentation of the epidermis region in immunofluorescence images is a prior image processing task, which is critical to the understanding of the diseases. Due to the deficiency of appropriate tools for this particular mission, this paper explores the possibility of an automatic epidermis segmentation framework in skin immunofluorescence images. To preserve the high resolution while increasing the image amount, each original image is partitioned into a series of subimages with a manageable dimension for model processing. A U-shaped network structure consisting of five layer blocks with different depths is investigated for epidermis segmentation. The central unit is the multiscale convolution block, which comprises two different convolution pipelines. By integrating and participating the information from these multiscale convolution blocks with intensive skip connections between them, we can effectively strengthen the diversity of the feature maps for more accurate segmentation. The proposed epidermis segmentation network was evaluated on an in-house epidermis image dataset in comparison with seven state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods. Experimental results indicated that our segmentation system achieved the largest overall Dice score of 92.80%, which outperformed other competing network models. It was believed that this new segmentation scheme is promising in facilitating the epidermis extraction task for further SFN-related investigation.","Engineering, Biomedical",Multiscale convolution block U-Net for automatic epidermis segmentation in immunofluorescence images,,[]

In this paper, we propose a novel parallel interweave fusion network for knee joint segmentation on magnetic resonance images (MRIs), called PIF-Net, which makes full use of hierarchical parallel paths and interaction fusion mechanisms to effectively address the limitations of multi-class organ segmentation in knee joint images. Specifically, each parallel intra-path can extract a series of complementary information via dense connection blocks, which take into account both diverse object scales and local details. Meanwhile, we build up the cross-path relations in a dense connections manner, which is conducive to gradually enhancing feature representation and filtering out false features with different labels but similar appearances. In the output phase, we design a global feature fusion network to incorporate the advantages of multi-resolution input versions extracted from hierarchical parallel paths.

This study aims to improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency by applying deep learning-based image registration between CT and MR images. Initially, the iterative closest point (ICP) technique was utilized to extract point clouds from CT and MR images and their corresponding segmentation masks. Through ICP-based alignment, the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) for the segmentation mask (specifically, the femur head) improved from 0.29 to 0.91, and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) also decreased. However, to achieve more precise registration, a Cycle-GAN-based generative model was employed to synthesize CT (sCT) images from MR images, enabling registration to be performed on modality-unified images. The generated sCT images demonstrated high similarity to actual CT images, as indicated by a PSNR of 20.57 and an NCC of 0.93. Subsequently, registered between the MR images and sCT images yielded to a PSNR of 12.95 and an NCC of 0.62, indicating strong alignment with the CT images. This study addresses the inherent challenges of multi-modality image registration and highlights the effectiveness of utilizing unified synthetic images for improved registration performance. Future research will focus on enhancing data diversity and quality, as well as refining deep learning model architectures to further advance registration accuracy.

However, acquiring such datasets is often expensive and time-consuming. To address this challenge, we propose leveraging generative image models, specifically diffusion models, to synthesize realistic MRI brain images. This study investigates the efficacy of two approaches: utilizing ControlNet and employing a customdesigned diffusion model. We evaluate the impact of these synthetic images on U-Net model training in two scenarios: (i) training on real, artificial, and mixed datasets of equal size, and (ii) incrementally augmenting a small real dataset with increasing amounts of synthetic data. We also benchmark the diffusion models against GAN-based competitors to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of their performance. Our findings demonstrate that both diffusion models effectively generate high-quality brain outperforming GANs in this task. Specifically, synthetic data generated by the diffusion models effectively approximates real brain image data, with minimal impact on segmentation performance, with only a 1.5% performance loss observed. Also, it significantly improves the U-Net's brain lesion segmentation performance when incorporated into the training process. Finally, our findings demonstrate that diffusion-generated images are more effective than GAN-generated images for improving segmentation model training.

We propose a time-frequency feature fusion model. The model transforms the time-domain pulse wave into a 144-dimensional time-domain and a 36-dimensional frequency-domain feature map, which are then fused in parallel connection-superposition to increase information volume and dimensionality, thereby enhancing the distinguishability of pulse wave features. Multiple small-scale dilated convolution kernels are stacked to replace large-scale standard convolutions, reducing the effects of ""receptive field center bias"" and model parameters, while enhancing global feature perception capabilities. The structure reparameterization technique is introduced into dilated convolutions, utilizing depthwise separable convolutions to replace largescale dilated convolutions, and channel shuffling operation is introduced to increase cross-channel information exchange, further reducing model redundancy and improving prediction accuracy and generalization performance.

This study compares FM and FCM in evaluating the cytotoxicity of Bioglass 45S5 (BG) on SAOS-2 osteoblast-like cells across different particle sizes and concentrations. The cells were treated with BG particles in three size ranges (< 38 m, 63-125 mu m, and 315-500 mu m) at concentrations of 25, 50, and 100 mg/mL for 3 and 72 h. FM employs FDA/PI staining to distinguish viable and nonviable cells, whereas FCM utilizes multiparametric staining (Hoechst, DiIC1, Annexin V-FITC, and PI) to classify viable, apoptotic, and necrotic populations. Both techniques confirmed a clear trend: smaller particles and higher concentrations caused greater cytotoxicity. The most pronounced effect was observed for < 38 m particles at 100 mg/mL, which reduced FM-assessed viability to 9% at 3 h and 10% at 72 h; FCM measurements under the same conditions revealed 0.2% and 0.7% viability, respectively. The controls retained > 97% viability, indicating size-based cytotoxicity. A strong correlation between FM and FCM data (r = 0.94, R-2 = 0.8879, p < 0.0001) was observed. FCM further distinguished early and late apoptosis from necrosis and demonstrated superior precision, particularly under high cytotoxic stress.

By using deep learning and transformation techniques, researchers can extract numerous features from EEG signals, allowing for a detailed analysis of the disease. However, handling such a huge amount of data is computationally demanding, especially for the fabrication of small, portable handheld PD detection devices, which are a dire need due to the alarming rates at which PD is rising. To overcome this challenge, an enhanced version of the artificial butterfly optimization (ABO) algorithm is introduced to select the most significant features from the feature vectors extracted from the time-frequency transformed EEG signals using a deep convolution network. The algorithm improves upon the original ABO by enhancing its ability to explore and refine feature selection. The main improvement is an adaptive mutation rate, which changes dynamically during the process, starting with a higher rate for more exploration in the beginning and lowering it over time for a more focused optimal solution as the training progresses. This allows for a more efficient selection of crucial features, which are then given to a deep neural network to detect PD. Results show that using this modified ABO (M-ABO) paired with a multilayer perceptron as a fitness evaluator leads to faster, more effective performance compared to the original ABO and particle swarm optimization, achieving accuracy rates of 98.24% and 96.85% on two publicly available datasets.","Engineering, Biomedical",Enhanced feature vector reduction of S-transformed electroencephalography signal for optimal Parkinson's disease detection,,[]

To better understand how aging impacts the mechanical properties of muscle as a function of age, a series of studies were conducted, using mice as a model system, to assess responses to longitudinal and transversal stresses at a single muscle fiber resolution. Methods: Muscle fibers isolated from primarily slow-twitch fibered muscle (soleus) and a primarily fast-twitch fibered muscle (extensor digitorum longus, EDL) were extracted from young (3-month, N=5) and old (21-month, N=5) animals. Passive mechanical tests (ramp, relaxation) were performed in the longitudinal direction at 50% strain, and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) tests were applied transversally. Longitudinal stresses (dynamic (sigma d), instantaneous (sigma i_Ramp) and static (sigma s_Relax)) and the Young's modulus were measured in both directions. Results: For both types of fibers, longitudinal stresses were shown to be significantly decreased (p < 0.001) in aged mice, with accentuated decreases observed for the EDL. Transversal AFM tests were used to elucidate the cartographies of elasticity and revealed no global differences between young and old animals for either fiber type. Regardless of age, decreased mechanical properties were universally observed for EDL fibers compared to soleus fibers. Conclusion: These findings highlight the potential of AFM to quantify transversal stiffness of the endomysium and have begun to better delineate the impacts of aging on the mechanical characteristics of skeletal muscle at single fiber resolution.

Nowadays, the continuous measurement of BP is only possible with an invasive measurement method using catheter as the gold standard. Diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) is a powerful tool for assessing microvascular hemodynamics in deep tissues, which can reliably provide a blood flow index whose changes are proportional to relative changes in tissue blood flow (BF). This study presents a new solution that enables to use tissue BF measured by our developed DCS device for continuous BP monitoring via deep learning approach. We evaluated the utility of tissue BF for continuous BP estimation via a proposed BFBP model. In vivo experiments (12 subjects) were performed to collect tissue BF and continuous BP data simultaneously to verify the feasibility of BFBP model. The mean absolute errors of the continuous BP estimates were 5.54 +/- 5.03 mm Hg for systolic BP, 1.71 +/- 2.86 mm Hg for diastolic BP, indicating that DCS provides a novel way for continuous BP estimation. Moreover, we compared the proposed BFBP model with other models based on an open BP dataset from UC Irvine database. The experimental results indicated that the estimated continuous BP achieves grade A for both systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure according to the British Hypertension Society standard. Ultimately, experimental results show that the proposed method enables feasible continuous estimation of BP using noninvasive tissue BF measured by our developed DCS device based on the proposed BFBP model.

Yet, traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) face limitations in local receptive fields and Transformer models exhibit high computational complexity when processing complex medical images. In recent years, State Space Models (SSMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities in the field of vision, in particular Mamba and its variants. They are distinguished in long-distance modeling while preserving linear computational efficiency in the context. However, simple skip connections still have limitations in capturing non-local multi-scale features, and their capacity for feature extraction might not reach the desired level of effectiveness. In response to these challenges, we propose a new model named Multi-scale Feature Fusion and Enhancement Vision Mamba UNet (MFEVM-UNet). Specifically, we introduce the Spatial Feature Gating Convolution (SFGC) module to improve spatial feature extraction and representation. Additionally, we employ the Mixed-Scale Interaction Module (MSIM) to obtain more enriched multi-scale feature representations. Finally, a balance between local and global features is achieved through a Local-2D-Selective-Scan (Local-SS2D), integrating a local scanning strategy with 2D-Selective-Scan (SS2D). We performed experiments on three public datasets: ISIC2017, ISIC2018, and CVC-ClinicDB, demonstrating the outstanding performance of our proposed MFEVM-UNet model in 2D medical segmentation tasks.

,0,2026-02-01,BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL,"EEG-based emotion recognition is crucial for the diagnosis and intervention of mental health disorders. However, volume conduction in EEG signals reduces spatial resolution, leading to suboptimal decoding performance. To address this, we propose a Graph Filtering-Based Multi-Granularity Spatial-Frequency Convolutional Attention Fusion Network (GF-MGSFCAFN). The framework consists of three core components: (1) A learnable graph filtering module constructs an individual brain graph for each subject based on imaginary coherence-derived functional connectivity, enabling the model to learn a more refined inter-electrode relationship network. This process effectively suppresses redundant electrical signal at each electrode and enhances spatial resolution; (2) The filtered EEG signals are then processed via multi-granularity spatial-frequency feature extraction. Since emotional responses arise from coordinated activation across multiple brain regions, we independently extract emotion-relevant features from each region and integrate them with full-brain representations, capturing rich spatial-frequency patterns at multiple granularity levels; (3) A multi-scale channel attention mechanism is designed to adaptively fuse features across different brain regions. Emotion classification is finally achieved through a multi-layer perceptron classifier. Subject-dependent and subject-independent experiments were conducted on public EEG emotion datasets SEED and SEED-IV. Results demonstrate that under subject-dependent settings, our model achieves average accuracies of 95.67% (SEED) and 84.20% (SEED-IV). Under subject-independent settings, it attains 84.53% (SEED) and 73.32% (SEED-IV), significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Chest X-rays and clinical texts are crucial auxiliary diagnostic tools that provide essential visual and textual information. A multimodal HF diagnosis model, biomedical modality interaction contrastive learning (BioMICL), is introduced in this work, which creates a dataset of chest X-ray and clinical text pairs.

,0,2025-08-01,IRBM,"Background and Objective: The paper aims to demonstrate the integration of advanced technologies, including computed tomography (CT), computer-aided design (CAD), and additive manufacturing, for precise surgical planning and personalized solutions in the management of Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI). The main research question is to determine how these technologies can be utilized to achieve successful surgical outcomes in severe cases of OI, such as the one presented in this study. Methods: The study involved an 11-year-old child with OI who suffered from a closed right diaphyseal femur fracture and severe lower extremity abnormalities. Virtual and physical planning procedures were carried out using CAD software based on patient-specific CT models. The length of the proximal and distal segments, cutting planes, and osteotomies were precisely defined to achieve the desired surgical corrections. Additionally, 3D models of the bones and bony segments were manufactured using additive manufacturing to physically recreate the surgical procedure. Results: The surgical treatment involved the correction of the right femur fracture and the left tibia and fibula in the first procedure, followed by the correction of the remaining segments in a second procedure. The Fassier-Duval telescopic intramedullary nail was used to stabilize the fracture and the osteotomy sites. The entire treatment course, from the first surgery to achieving partial weight-bearing, spanned approximately 15 weeks, including the two surgical procedures and staged rehabilitation. Post-surgery, the patient showed significant functional improvement, including the ability to stand and walk with assistance. Conclusion: The integration of advanced technologies in surgical planning for OI patients has shown promising results, leading to improved patient outcomes and reduced complications. This approach has the potential to enhance the accuracy of preoperative planning and provide personalized and precise solutions, ultimately elevating the overall quality of healthcare for OI patients.

Materials and methods: We retrospectively analyzed data from our previous RCTs, including 1,651 invasive arterial plasma dilution (aPD), 1,645 noninvasive ""capillary"" plasma dilution (cPD) and 236 estimates of EQ_Hct from 236 perioperative mVLT sessions. The cPD was estimated using noninvasive hemoglobin (SpHb, Masimo Radical 7, Irvine, CA) measurement. Fixed number of crystalloid boluses was used in 36 and 48 elective total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients, and individualized number of boluses in 34 total hip arthroplasty (THA) patients for whom the number of boluses depended on the advices by our prototype automated clinical decision support system (ACDSS). Results: The primary hypothesis was confirmed-aPD decreased as EQ_Hct decreased when EQ_Hct <40%, and a very weak positive correlation was found between EQ_Hct and absolute aPD (Spearman's correlation coefficient 0.1025, p < 0.001). It was also confirmed when non-invasive data sets were used. A very weak negative correlation between HctEQ values and absolute cPD values (Spearman's correlation coefficient 0.0640, p = 0.0149).

Unlike conventional approaches that require detailed knowledge of the cellular or molecular mechanisms of cancer, DeePC relies exclusively on input-output data collected during an initial learning phase. In this phase, pseudo-random binary sequences (PRBS) of Angiostatin and Endostatin are administered at safe dose limits of 20 mg/kg, and tumor volume measurements are recorded daily over a period of 62 to 116 days. The predictive capabilities of DeePC enable periodic control and measurement updates (typically every 10 days), which effectively manage tumor growth under varying levels of uncertainty. The study evaluates the nonlinear tumor dynamics under scenarios of 1% to 31% uncertainty in the state equations and output measurements, demonstrating the robustness of DeePC to noise and disturbances. Simulation results show that the framework can suppress tumor volume to negligible levels using low average doses, though performance depends on the selected DeePC parameters and the level of measurement and process noise. These findings underscore the potential of DeePC as a safe, efficient, and fully data-driven approach to targeted cancer therapy.","Engineering, Biomedical",Targeted cancer therapy by nonlinear data-enabled predictive control (DeePC): A case study on lewis lung carcinoma,,[]

Since each analysis step impacts on the muscle synergies influencing the results interpretation, this study aims at i) optimising the procedure of muscular synergies extraction in BBT and ii) applying it to characterise BBT in healthy individuals. Electromyographic (EMG) data (8 muscles per arm) were recorded from 16 participants during the BBT performed with each upper limb, separately. Muscle synergies were extracted by means of the Non-Negative Matrix Factorization method and the impact of following two parameters was estimated: (i) cut-off frequency of lowpass filter designed to compute the envelope of the EMG signals (ii) type of normalisation to be applied to the EMG envelopes. Results show that the procedure of muscular synergies extraction requires to be optimised with particular attention to the cut-off frequency of low-pass filter designed to compute the envelope of the EMG signals and the type of normalisation to be applied to the EMG envelopes. From the physiological perspective, three synergies seem to be enough to capture main BBT movement mechanisms.

,2,2026-01-01,BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL,"Automatic seizure detection is of critical importance for clinical epilepsy treatment. Due to the variability of Electroencephalography (EEG) patterns across different individuals, most existing seizure detection methods fails to generalize across patients. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a cross-subject seizure detection combines Vision Transformer (ViT) and unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). Specifically, to enhance the generalization ability of the ViT backbone across different subjects, an adversarial network is introduced on the class token to disentangle global transferable features. Meanwhile, the multi-head attention mechanism is replaced by the transfer adaptation module (TAM) to disentangle transferable features at the patch level. Additionally, to retain the discriminative features related to epileptic seizures, a discriminative clustering module (DCM) is introduced to constrain the model. Our experiments on the CHB-MIT dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves strong performance in both evaluation paradigms: in epoch-based analysis it attains 89.20% accuracy, 91.05% sensitivity, and 94.54% specificity, while in event-based evaluation it maintains 89.23% sensitivity with a low false detection rate of 0.42/h.

This study develop and evaluate a dynamic warning system based on non-invasive features, aimed at predicting the likelihood of hypothermia occurring in trauma patients within the next hour. 462 patients from the eICU database were selected on the basis of meeting the inclusion criteria, and 19 non-invasive and 17 invasive features were extracted. Five classic machine learning methods were employed to develop dynamic early warning model for hypothermia based on various observation windows, with multi-center data used for model validation. The shapley additive explanations (SHAP) algorithm was utilized to analyze the interpretability of the model, and ablation experiments were conducted to further evaluate the contribution of significant feature to the prediction performance. The AUC values of the optimal models based on non-invasive features in the same test set are 0.838. When using cross-hospital data as the validation set, the highest AUC values for the same models based on non-invasive features decrease by only 0.015. In addition, ablation experiments reveal that the model's AUC exhibited a 0.010 improvement when the three most influential invasive features were incorporated into the non-invasive feature set.

The limited representation of rare disease samples in SSL's labeled datasets compromises the model's ability to effectively identify these uncommon conditions. In this work, we propose a novel two-stage Rare-Disease-Oriented Annotation (RDOA) framework that aims to enhance the proportion of rare instances in labeled datasets within a limited annotation budget. In Stage1, given the complete absence of labeled data in the initial phase, we propose an unsupervised strategy to maximize rare disease samples coverage by selecting a wide range of diverse instances for annotation, whose prior label knowledge will guide the annotation process in next stage. In Stage2, building upon the model trained on the annotated samples in Stage1, we introduce a supervised approach to detect samples near the classification boundaries and prioritize their annotation, which aims to increase the likelihood of labeling rare disease samples. Upon completing the annotation process, both labeled and unlabeled data can be utilized to train semi-supervised learning algorithms. We validate our proposed framework with extensive experiments on three public long-tailed medical image datasets: the ISIC2018 skin lesion challenge, OCT ophthalmic dataset, ChestX-ray14 thorax disease classification. Experimental results showed that various SSL methods trained on our meticulously annotated instances achieved higher performance on uncommon cases.

Despite their effectiveness, physiological tremors in the surgeon's hand may propagate to the robotic arm's end-effector, compromising procedural quality and potentially causing secondary injury. To tackle this issue, a tremor suppression approach was proposed, utilizing the PSOUKF algorithm. First, the simulation model incorporating both surgical and tremor signal characteristics was established, creating a mixed signal that reflected actual operational conditions. The PSOUKF algorithm was then applied to filter the tremor signal, and its suppression effect was compared to alternative algorithms. The experimental findings revealed that the PSOUKF algorithm attained an RMSE of 0.0002, representing reductions of 99.96% compared to the Low-Pass Filter (LPF) and 99.92% compared to the Kalman Filter (KF), respectively. Furthermore, the proposed method achieved a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of 63.70 dB, which is approximately 27.7% higher than that of the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). The PSOUKF algorithm improved adaptability and robustness by adjusting the noise covariance matrix in complex environments. Additionally, a distributed parallel optimization strategy minimized computational complexity, enabling real-time responsiveness.

Traditional single-component scaffolds often lack sufficient mechani-cal strength for complex in vivo conditions. This study introduces a chitosan/gelatin/carrageenan (CGC) composite scaffold designed to improve therapeutic outcomes. Methods The CGC scaffold was fabricated via freeze-drying, and its microstructure was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), confirming the presence of interconnected pores (100-200 mu m). The mechanical properties of the chito-san/gelatin (CG) and CGC scaffolds were assessed via compression testing, and the swelling ratios in PBS were measured gravimetrically. Rat primary chondrocytes were cultured on both scaffolds to evaluate biocompatibility, proliferation, and extracellular matrix (ECM) production, and in vivo biocompatibility was tested following subcutaneous implantation in rats. Results The CGC scaffold exhibited a higher compressive strength and equilibrium swelling ratio and displayed superior mechanical and swelling properties. MTT assays conducted on Days 14 and 21 revealed enhanced chondrocyte proliferation on the CGC scaffold, indicating its superiority in terms of sustained cell growth. Notably, the SEM analysis confirmed that the CGC scaffold retained the spherical morphology of the chondrocytes on Day 21, whereas the CG scaffold exhibited less cell retention, demonstrating the advantages of CGC in preserving cells. Histological and immunofluorescence analyses con-firmed increased glycosaminoglycan deposition and type II collagen expression in cells grown on the CGC scaffolds. Addi-tionally, no pathological changes in vital organs were detected in the rats after subcutaneous implantation of the scaffold.

Millions of people worldwide are affected by vibration-related health issues every year. However, prolonged exposure to vibration can have serious health implications, including back pain, muscle strain, and damage to nerves and blood vessels. While computational modelling studies and tests on dummies have been performed, these do not accurately simulate the structural and material components of the spine, leading to less accurate results. Therefore, this study attempted to develop a biofidelic spine model using 3D printing technology and based on the THUMS Dummy model (AM50 V 4.02 Pedestrian) that closely simulates a real human spine structure. This developed model was used to perform the experiment exposed to vertical sinusoidal vibrations under different magnitudes (1.1 m/s2, 0.75 m/s2, and 0.4 m/s2) in the frequency range of 1-20 Hz. The collected data sets were analyzed to study the effect of vertical sinusoidal vibration magnitude and obtain the L5 to C1 transmissibility curves across a specified frequency range. The transmissibility curve was further analyzed to appraise the biofidelity of the developed human spine model and compare it to the literature. The results depicted that the two resonance peaks were observed between 2 and 3.5 Hz and 4-6 Hz at magnitude 1.1 m/s2 and 0.75 m/s2, respectively, and the multiple resonance peaks were observed at the magnitude of 0.4 m/s2.

For a more comprehensive assessment of online SEMG decomposition, a two-source validation was conducted by simultaneously collecting intramuscular EMG (IEMG) and high-density SEMG signals. The IEMG signal was decomposed using a simplified version of Progressive FastICA Peel-off (PFP) method with a combination of the peel-off strategy and the valley-seeking clustering, and the decomposed motor unit (MU) spike trains were used as the ground-truth reference. For SEMG recordings, the signals within initial 5 seconds were used to offline obtain MU separation vectors and these vectors were subsequently employed to extract MU spike trains in the online stage. The matching rate of the common firing events from the ground-truth reference and online SEMG decomposition were calculated and assessed. A total of 549 and 92 MUs were identified from the SEMG and IEMG signals from 5 healthy subjects' first dorsal interosseous muscle. All the MUs decomposed from IEMG can be matched with MUs from online SEMG decomposition and the average matching rate in the online stage was (96 +/- 1) %.

Methods: A deep U-Net network, incorporating densely connected convolutional and deconvolutional blocks, was trained and validated on a dataset of 188 lung cancer patients. In the modeling framework, an MRCS is first transformed to the individualized prescription image required by the network. The distance to target (DT) is calculated using three-dimensional Euclidean distance for each voxel within the patient outline. A linear formulation is proposed to establish a direct relationship between the individualized prescription image and DT. The performance of the network was analyzed on a test set comprising 47 additional lung cancer patients and compared with the performance of the network blinded to MRCS. The mean absolute error (MAE) and paired-samples t-test were used to compute the dose differences, clinical interest dose-volume histogram (DVH) metrics, and Dice similarity coefficients (DSC) of isodose volumes. Results: The network incorporating MRCS achieved an average MAE of 3.73% for dose differences, average MAE of no greater than 5.77% for DVH metrics, and average DSC of 0.86 (0.84-1) for isodose volumes.

Recently, in a measurement setup with automated sample re-orientation, it was demonstrated that T2 can be split into its orientation-independent components. This quantitative MRI study aims to assess the diagnostic significance of the automated approach with ex vivo human cartilage. MethodsT2 maps of 30 human osteochondral samples harvested from 5 cadaveric individuals were acquired at 9.4T in 13 orientations, allowing calculation of the T2 components. Additionally, T1, adiabatic T1 rho, and continuous wave T1 rho with two spin-lock frequencies were scanned in a single orientation. For reference, the collagen network anisotropy, proteoglycan content and biomechanical indentation properties were measured. The relationships between quantitative MRI and reference parameters were studied using Mann-Whitney U-test and Spearman's rank correlation. All parameters were compared between healthy and degenerated groups based on OARSI grading. ResultsThe anisotropic relaxation rate component of T2 (R2a), and all T1 and T1 rho parameters differed (p < 0.05) between the groups in superficial cartilage. R2a correlated moderately with PLM anisotropy (r = 0.44) and optical density (r = - 0.37) in the deep zone. Isotropic T2 component (R2i) correlated with instantaneous modulus (r = 0.48), and R2a with phase shift between stress and strain during indentation testing (r = - 0.44). T1 and T1 rho parameters correlated with both, instantaneous and dynamic modulus in several zones of cartilage. ConclusionThe elevation of T2 in degenerated cartilage is primarily driven by the R2a component, whereas the R2i component showed no significant difference between healthy and degenerated human articular cartilage.","Engineering, Biomedical",Orientation-Independent T2 Mapping Enhances MRI-Based Cartilage Characterization,,[]

We advance the argument that these DNEs capture the degree of expression of respective neuroanatomical patterns measured, offering a dimensional neuroanatomical representation for studying disease heterogeneity and similarities of neurologic and neuropsychiatric diseases. We investigate the presence of nine DNEs derived from independent yet harmonized studies on Alzheimer's disease, autism spectrum disorder, late-life depression and schizophrenia in the UK Biobank study. Phenome-wide associations align with genome-wide associations, revealing 31 genomic loci (P < 5 x 10(-8)/9) associated with the nine DNEs. The nine DNEs, along with their polygenic risk scores, significantly enhanced the predictive accuracy for 14 systemic disease categories, particularly for conditions related to mental health and the central nervous system, as well as mortality outcomes. These findings underscore the potential of the nine DNEs to capture the expression of disease-related brain phenotypes in individuals of the general population and to relate such measures with genetics, lifestyle factors and chronic diseases.","Engineering, Biomedical",Neuroimaging endophenotypes reveal underlying mechanisms and genetic factors contributing to progression and development of four brain disorders,,[]
,0,2025-06-01,APL BIOENGINEERING,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly lethal and heterogeneous tumor driven by the dysregulation of multiple genes. Tubulin tyrosine ligase-like 4 (TTLL4) has been linked to tumor progression, but its specific role in HCC pathogenesis remains unclear. RNA sequencing data, somatic mutation profiles, and clinical characteristics were analyzed from TCGA, GEO, and TIMER databases. The effects of TTLL4 on cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis were studied using functional assays and flow cytometry. In vivo, tumor growth and metastasis were evaluated through subcutaneous implantation and tail vein injection. Immunohistochemistry assessed TTLL4 and Ki-67 expression. TTLL4 was upregulated in HCC and associated with poor prognosis, linking it to cancer progression and the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. Knockdown of TTLL4 in HCC cells reduced proliferation, migration, and colony formation while increasing apoptosis. In vivo, TTLL4 knockdown slowed tumor growth and reduced lung metastasis. It also decreased the expression of proteins in the PI3K/AKT/MDM2 pathway, while overexpression upregulated these proteins. Rescue experiments further suggest that TTLL4 may exert its regulatory effects on this pathway by modulating PI3K expression levels. TTLL4 plays a significant role in HCC progression via the PI3K/AKT/MDM2 pathway and may serve as a novel therapeutic target for HCC diagnosis and treatment. (c) 2025 Author(s).

Consequently, semi-supervised learning methods are increasingly becoming popular. We propose the Pseudo Label-Guided Data Fusion framework, which builds upon the mean teacher network for segmenting medical images with limited annotation. We introduce a pseudo-labeling utilization scheme, which combines labeled and unlabeled data to augment the dataset effectively. Additionally, we enforce the consistency between different scales in the decoder module of the segmentation network and propose a loss function suitable for evaluating the consistency.

Methods: Investigational sockets with motor-driven adjustable panels were fabricated for each participant. Sensors to detect liner-to-socket distance were embedded in the socket wall during fabrication, and collected data were used to calculate a socket fit metric (SFM). Participants completed two military readiness assessments, the Readiness Evaluation during simulated Dismounted Operations and the Common Military Tasks, in each of three socket volume adjustment modes: static (non-adjustable), user-adjusted (using a phone app), and auto (adjusted by a controller). Socket and participant performance and self-reported outcome metrics were collected. Results: In 11 Service members or Veterans, the SFM distribution was significantly lower for the auto mode compared with the user-adjusted and static modes (P = 0.023, 0.010, respectively). The socket volume was adjusted more often (P = 0.003) and underwent a greater range of adjustment (P = 0.001) for auto versus user-adjusted. The change in pre- and post-activity socket comfort score (SCS) was not significantly different between modes. Conclusions: The results highlight the errors in socket fit in static and user-adjusted sockets and demonstrate how an automatically adjusting socket can minimize error without impeding task performance.","Engineering, Biomedical",Testing an adjustable prosthetic socket in a simulated military environment,,[]

A soft multichannel ABI, fabricated using thin-film processing, provided high-resolution auditory percepts, with spatially distinct stimulation sites eliciting cortical responses akin to frequency-specific tuning. Behavioural responses collected over several months were sufficiently precise to distinguish stimulations from adjacent channels.

,0,2025-06-01,IRBM,"Background and Objective: Current in vivo imaging modalities such as CT and MRI provide low-resolution (LR) skeletal images of a limited resolution (400 to 600 }m), which is insufficient to precisely evaluate bone strength. Similarly, recent deep learning technologies show a limitation in terms of upscale ratio and image size. They also require a large number of high-resolution (HR) reference images for training, which are unavailable to acquire in clinical practice. Although topology optimization shows the potential to reconstruct HR skeletal images from CT scan data, it requires extreme computing cost for a limited region of interest (ROI). The goal of this study is to acquire a 2D HR full proximal femur image by reconstructing HR patch images via a deep neural network and merging them seamlessly. Methods: Topology optimization was conducted to generate synthetic proximal femur images. After these HR images were downscaled 10 times, finite element analysis was conducted to evaluate the structural behavior of the downscaled LR images. By dividing the proximal femur images into a set of patches which share their cut boundary, we could generate a total of 52,000 pairs of the HR and LR image patches and the LR structural behavior (nodal displacement in this study). Then, these patch-wise data were used to train three different deep neural networks: ResNet, U-Net, and SRGAN. Finally, after the HR patch images were upscaled 10 times by the trained networks, they were seamlessly merged by minimizing a structural discontinuity on the patch boundary. Results: The reconstructed HR proximal femur images were evaluated at three different ROIs in terms of image quality, apparent stiffness, and trabecular morphometric indices. They showed characteristic trabecular patterns with no visible structural discontinuity between the patches in all ROIs. Among three networks, ResNet showed the best performance in all quantitative measures. Conclusion: This study proposes a novel framework that incorporates deep learning-based patchwise reconstruction and seamless quilting algorithm. Because the proposed method requires a very small number of reference HR images (only 11 synthetic full proximal femur images in total), it could be expanded to reconstruct trabecular bone from 3D clinical CT scan data for more reliable bone strength assessment in clinical practice.

Approximately 10% to 15% of breast cancer patients fail to undergo timely screening, resulting in a missed opportunity for optimal treatment. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have been used successfully in breast cancer diagnosis. Nevertheless, current systems have encountered difficulties in achieving a high degree of accuracy, with the majority of research efforts focusing on the binary classification that distinguishes benign from malignant. Different subtypes of breast cancer require different targeted therapeutic approaches. Therefore, the precise classification of the breast cancer subtype has a major impact on treatment decisions. To improve the accuracy of breast cancer multi-classification, a novel Attention-based Mask Reconstruction Module (AMRM) is proposed to improve the performance of the model. AMRM extracts features from breast cancer histopathological images through the attention module and then performs mask reconstruction to generate reconstructed features. These reconstructed features were used in a multi-classification task to accurately classify histopathological images of breast cancer. AMRM enables the network to effectively identify background and foreground in histopathological images, reduce background interference, improve adaptability to background changes, align the features extracted by the model with the pathologist's expectations, and improve classification accuracy. Results from experiments conducted on the BreakHis dataset show that the inclusion of AMRM resulted in a significant improvement in multi-classification accuracy for the AlexNet, VGG11, ResNet-50 and Data-efficient Image Transformer (DeiT) models, reaching 88.48%, 93.40%, 96.49% and 94.10% respectively.

The noise associated with the images can minimize the clearness of the image, which leads to the misidentification of the diseases. Hence, the denoising of images is an essential process in healthcare applications. In this work, a medical image denoising method based on chronological walrus behavior optimization (CWaOA) is proposed. The process begins by identifying the noisy pixels in the image, which is achieved using LeNet to detect the noisy pixel map. The CWaOA algorithm is used for removing the noise from the image. To enhance the image pixels, the vectorial total variation (VTV) norm is employed. Simultaneously, the input image undergoes transformation using the dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT) to process its low-frequency components. A Gaussian filter is applied for image filtering, and the denoised image is obtained by applying inverse DTCWT. Based on the image quality accessed metrics like natural image quality evaluator (NIQE), universal quality index (UQI), and structural similarity index (SSIM), the denoised image and pixel-enhanced image fusion is done at the final step. Additionally, the performance of the model is evaluated using the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), second derivative-like measure of enhancement (SDME), and SSIM metrics, yielding superior results with PSNR of 30.03 dB, SDME of 41.94 dB, and SSIM of 0.883.

Current chemotherapies, including gemcitabine (Gem) in combination treatment regimens, produce dose-limiting toxicity, drug resistance, and ultimately limited improvement in the overall survival of PC patients. Niclosamide (Nic), a clinically safe FDA-approved anthelmintic drug has been shown to have anti-cancer properties; however, its limited bioavailability makes Nic largely ineffective as a therapeutic agent. To address this challenge, we have developed a novel combination therapy of Gem with the repurposed drug, Nic, loaded in biodegradable polyanhydride nanoparticles (NicNp), as an effective treatment option for PC.MethodsWe synthesized and characterized NicNp in vitro and evaluated their biodistribution and efficacy in xenograft and syngeneic pancreatic tumor models in mice.ResultsThe biodistribution study indicated that NicNp accumulated in high concentrations in the pancreatic tumors of the mice with Cmax of 138 +/- 74.1 mu g Nic/g tissue. NicNp treatment, in combination with Gem, worked synergistically to reduce the dose of gemcitabine required to kill pancreatic cancer cells in vitro, two-fold. Additionally, the pancreatic tumor burden in the mouse models was significantly reduced, while survival was significantly increased when mice bearing pancreatic tumors were treated with the combination of NicNp and Gem.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates the potential for effective repurposing Nic via nanoformulations in combination with Gem to improve PC treatment efficacy.Lay summaryPancreatic cancer (PC) ranks among the most lethal types of cancer, with largely ineffective current treatments and toxic side effects in patients.

The primary challenge lies in uncovering the correlations among physiological information, nutritional intake, and other features, and addressing the issue of scale disparity among these features, in addition to considering the impact of individual variances on the model's accuracy. This paper introduces a universal, wearable device-assisted, multi-scale feature fusion model for realtime blood glucose monitoring and hyperglycemia prediction. It aims to more effectively capture the local correlations between diverse features and their inherent temporal relationships, overcoming the challenges of physiological data redundancy at large time scales and the incompleteness of nutritional intake data at smaller time scales. Furthermore, we have devised a personalized tuner strategy to enhance the model's accuracy and stability by continuously collecting personal data from users of the wearable devices to fine-tune the generic model, thereby accommodating individual differences and providing patients with more precise health management services. The model's performance, assessed using public datasets, indicates that the real-time monitoring error in terms of Mean Squared Error (MSE) is 0.22mmol/L, with a prediction accuracy for hyperglycemia occurrences of 96.75%. The implementation of the personalized tuner strategy yielded an average improvement rate of 1.96% on individual user datasets. This study on blood glucose monitoring and hyperglycemia prediction, facilitated by wearable devices, assists users in better managing their blood sugar levels and holds significant clinical application prospects.","Engineering, Biomedical",Multi-scale feature fusion model for real-time Blood glucose monitoring and hyperglycemia prediction based on wearable devices,,[]
,0,2025-05-01,ANNALS OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING,"Physical surrogates of the human head are commonly used to model cranial impacts, assess helmet efficacy and assess likelihood of head injuries. The Brain Injury Protection Evaluation Device (BIPED mk2) is a head form that contains a brain simulant, cerebrospinal fluid layer (CSF), connective membranes, a skull and a skin layer, and can be configured to measure kinematics, pressures and strains. In design efforts to increase the biofidelity of surrogates, finite element models play a significant role in assessing design iterations that better mimic the biological response of the head during impact. This study aims to create a digital model of the BIPED mk2 and provide a robust comparison to experimental pressure and strain data, measured from specific impact scenarios. Kinematics from two separate frontal impact experiment campaigns were used to drive the BIPED mk2 finite element model. In the first experiments, brain pressure was extracted from in situ transducers. In the second, brain strain was extracted from post hoc imagery analysis. These pressure and strain data are the basis on which we verify the pressures and strains reported from the finite element model. Pressure and displacement time series responses were compared with experimental data using a CORrelation Analysis (CORA). The average CORA rating for pressure measurements taken at the front brain sensor was 0.701 using the kinematic model inputs and 0.851 for the force model inputs. For the rear brain sensor, the signals were deemed poor fits as the average CORA scores were 0.442 for the kinematic input and 0.255 for the force input. CORA ratings for the comparison of displacement data in the x (anterior-posterior) and z (superior-inferior) directions of the 18 nodes tested resulted in a range of values from 0.012 to 0.936. The results matched best in the interior but were poor along the perimeter of the brain depending on the location of the point in relation to the brain surface. We speculate the mixed findings are due in large part to the simplified CSF model, a potential focus for future model refinement.","Engineering, Biomedical",Development of a Detailed Finite Element Model of the BIPED MK2 and Verification of Fidelity in Two Cases of Blunt Impact,,[]

Studies have shown that the average survival period of an individual without the functioning of either kidney is usually 18 days, after which transplants or dialysis have to be resorted to. Therefore, early detection becomes important. Diagnosis using ML and DL methods are quite efficient, but their decision processes are not transparent. In medical diagnosis, Machine Learning and DL techniques offer considerably high accuracy in disease prediction. Besides that, analyzing the influence of feature selection and extraction becomes very important in order to come up with high-quality and consistent outcomes.The efficacy of these strategies relies on proper feature selection, extraction, and classifiers. The objective of the research is to propose a novel framework to identify the optimal feature for early prediction of CKD. It uses exhaustive feature selection to identify pertinent features, processed by autoencoders and variational auto encoders for dimensionality reduction. This research paper identifies the better classifiers by comparing various ML algorithms such as GB, XGBoost,DT, RF, LR, and KNN and the DL classifier such as CNN for early CKD prediction, using advanced feature extraction methods.We conducted extensive experimental analysis using a standard dataset collected from Kaggle.

,0,2025-08-01,BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL,"Reducing k-space sampling points by specifying the sampling ratios and paths is essential for accelerating MRI. However, overcoming the degradation of image quality due to under-sampling remains a significant challenge. Current convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that focus on either the k-space or image domain fail to fully utilize the complementary information available in both domains, limiting reconstruction accuracy. Additionally, cross-domain reconstruction networks with dual-domain features frequently rely on repetitive stacking of identical interaction modules and lack essential multi-scale and multi-resolution feature compensation throughout the interaction process. To address these issues, we propose a dual-domain feature fusion deep convolutional neural network (DFFKI-Net). DFFKI-Net is innovatively designed as a three-part cascade consisting of the K-space Domain Reconstruction Module (KDRM), Image Domain Reconstruction Module (IDRM), and Deep Parallel Cross-domain Feature Fusion Module (DPCFFM). The under-sampled k-space data is preliminarily processed in the KDRM to enhance the completeness of global frequency information, followed by further extraction of image details and edge features in the IDRM. A key innovation of this work is the cross-module compensation of multi-scale wavelet features from KDRM to IDRM, effectively reducing frequency information loss during propagation. Finally, the DPCFFM enables efficient cross-domain feature interaction and fusion, achieving more comprehensive feature extraction. Experimental results on fastMRI and CC359 datasets show that DFFKI-Net can adapt to different under-sampling rates and types of MRI data, achieving high reconstruction accuracy with limited parameters: NMSE of 0.0272, PSNR of 33.5 dB, and SSIM of 0.7803 on fastMRI 4 x single- coil knee dataset, with a total parameter count of less than one-fifteenth of the optimal method.","Engineering, Biomedical",DFFKI-Net: A dual-domain feature fusion deep convolutional neural network for under-sampled MR image reconstruction,,[]

While age estimation itself has limited clinical relevance, the residua between estimated biological and chronological age may serve as a proxy for a variety of health conditions. However, polysomnographic studies on infants and children with respect to age prediction are scarce. To address this gap, we studied a data set of 2097 pediatric PSGs (n = 1971; 43.9% females; 0-18 years) focusing on three disorders related to sleep dysfunctions. A DNN for age prediction was trained and five minutes of a PSG serving as input proved sufficient for age estimation, yielding a mean absolute error of 1.816 years. Ablation experiments showed that the DNN's decision-making was mainly based on brain signals. Moreover, we found systematic links between age estimation residua and two disorder clusters, namely cerebrovascular diseases and cerebral palsy. The distributions of residua differed significantly (two-sided t-test, p < 0.05) between case and control group and the relative risk of being diagnosed was greater than 1 under the risk factor of having an absolute residuum larger than 1.8 years. For hyperkinetic disorders including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), such links could not be identified. Our analysis shows that systematic patterns in pediatric PSGs can be deciphered by DNNs and could provide new ways to profile disorder-specific sleep.","Engineering, Biomedical",Age estimation for disorder characterization from pediatric polysomnograms,,[]

To address this, our group previously developed a hydraulic electrode insertion device, the Cochlea Hydrodrive (CHD), which automates the process using a syringe piston driven by an infusion pump. This study aims to characterize the hydraulic actuation process of the CHD and to preclinically evaluate its design.MethodsA camera-based motion tracking test setup was developed to obtain hydraulic motion profiles. Various syringes were evaluated for their actuation properties and the optimal syringe was selected. The CHD design was adapted based on the selected syringe, incorporating a slotted stainless steel guide tube to surround the electrode during insertion. This enhanced design was tested in ex vivo insertion trials into human head specimens.ResultsThe final design of the CHD demonstrated smooth and steady motion profiles at all tested velocities (0.4 mm/s, 0.1 mm/s, 0.03 mm/s). Ex vivo insertion trials confirmed these findings, with the guide tube facilitating easy alignment of the CHD in front of the round window and preventing electrode buckling.ConclusionOur study validates that the CHD provides reliably smooth actuation properties despite its low complexity.

The incidence of RSV exhibits marked seasonality and is influenced by various meteorological factors, which vary across regions and climates. This study aimed to analyze seasonal trends in RSV-related hospitalization in Tianjin, a region with a semi-arid and semi-humid monsoon climate, and to explore the relationship between these trends and meteorological factors. This research intends to inform RSV prevention strategies, optimize public health policies and medical resource allocation while also promoting vaccine and therapeutic drug development.MethodsThis study analyzed data from a cohort of 6222 children hospitalized with RSV-related infections. Meteorological data were collected from the Tianjin Binhai International Airport meteorological station, encompassing temperature (degrees C), air pressure (mmHg), wind speed (m/s), humidity (%), and precipitation (mm). We employed seasonal ARIMA and GAM models to investigate the association between meteorological factors and RSV-related hospitalizations.ResultsThe SARIMA (1,0,0) (0,1,2)12 model effectively predicted RSV-related hospital admissions. Spearman correlation and GAM analysis revealed a significant negative association between the monthly average temperature and RSV hospitalizations.ConclusionsOur findings indicated that meteorological factors influence RSV infection-related hospital admissions, with higher monthly average temperatures associated with fewer hospitalizations.

Methods: We applied the Fitting Oscillations & One-Over-F method to parameterize power spectra as a combination of periodic oscillations and an aperiodic component. Electroencephalographic responses and system performance were measured and compared using four prevailing methods: power spectral density analysis, canonical correlation analysis, filter bank canonical correlation analysis and the state-of-the-art method, task discriminant component analysis. Results: We found that controlling for the aperiodic component prominently downgraded the performance of brain-computer interfaces measured by canonical correlation analysis (94.9% to 82.8%), filter bank canonical correlation analysis (94.1% to 87.6%), and task discriminant component analysis (96.5% to 70.3%). However, it had almost no effect on that measured by power spectral density analysis (80.4% to 78.7%). This was accompanied by a differential aperiodic impact between power spectral density analysis and the other three methods on the differentiation of the target and non-target stimuli.

Current surgical treatments aim to mitigate these issues by resecting the paralyzed muscle or transposing the other recti muscles to the paralyzed muscle, but they do not fully improve the patient's quality of life. Electrical stimulation shows promise, while requiring further in vivo experiments and research on various stimulation parameters. In this study, we conducted experiments on rabbits to stimulate the superior rectus (SR) muscles using different parameters and stimulation waveforms. To provide various types of electrical stimulation, we developed the ocular muscle stimulation systems capable of both current controlled stimulation (CCS) and high-frequency stimulation (HFS), along with the chip that enables energy-efficient and safe switched-capacitor stimulation (SCS). We also developed electrodes for easy implantation and employed safe and efficient stimulation methods including CCS, SCS, and HFS. The in vivo animal experiments on normal and paralyzed SR muscles of rabbits showed that eyeball abduction angles were proportional to the current and pulse width of the stimulation. With the decaying exponential stimuli of the SCS system, eyeball abductions were 2.58x and 5.65x larger for normal and paralyzed muscles, respectively, compared to the rectangular stimulus of CCS. HFS achieved 0.92x and 0.26x abduction for normal and paralyzed muscles, respectively, with half energy compared to CCS.

Methods: Active vibrational data were non-invasively recorded using a miniature coin vibration motor and accelerometer. Twenty active vibration recordings from children diagnosed with JIA were used in the analysis. Machine learning algorithms were leveraged to classify the vibrational signatures according to the corresponding subject groups. Subjects were classified into symptomatic ERA (sxERA), asymptomatic ERA (asxERA), and asymptomatic JIA (non-ERA) (asxNERA) groups based on clinical evaluations and ILAR criteria. Results: Distinct vibrational signatures were observed during tiptoe standing, providing differentiation between subject groups. Feature-based and waveform-based approaches effectively classified the sxERA group against asxNERA and asxERA groups using leave-one-subject-out (LOSO-CV) and 3-fold cross-validation. For the 3-fold cross-validation, the mean accuracies for distinguishing sxERA from asxNERA were 81% (feature-based) and 81% (waveform-based), while the accuracies for discriminating sxERA against asxERA were 73% (feature-based) and 74% (waveform-based). Conclusion: Active vibrational sensing demonstrates promise as a tool for identifying Achilles tendon inflammation in JIA, potentially aiding in early diagnosis and disease monitoring.

By investigating functional connectivity differences between healthy controls and schizophrenia patients, including those with and without auditory hallucinations, researchers can study top-down and bottom-up processes in brain neural networks. This approach could yield interpretable models identifying task-related brain regions involved in memory retrieval. Research indicates that hallucinations stem from abnormal neural activity within the brain's generative decoding process. When pre-trained tokens in the embedded space are stimulated or spontaneously activated, they trigger the multi-head attention mechanism. This activates connections through the weighted vector memory structure. Altered perceptual experiences can be generated by spontaneously improvised content due to impaired brain connectivity, as shown by fMRI studies. This work aims to explore memory storage and retrieval processes in the brain by examining connectivity and regions of interest (ROIs) in resting-state and task-based fMRI datasets. It will also investigate the relationship between hallucination generation and impaired brain connectivity. Understanding the structure and function of the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) embedded space can help explore context misinterpretation and neural pattern misfiring.

Because MUD has become more prevalent due to the COVID-19 pandemic, alternative ways to help the efficiency of mass screening of MUD are important. Previous studies used electroencephalogram (EEG), heart rate variability (HRV), and galvanic skin response (GSR) aberrations during the virtual reality (VR) induction of drug craving to accurately separate patients with MUD from the healthy controls. However, whether these abnormalities present without induction of drug-cue reactivity to enable separation between patients and healthy subjects remains unclear. Here, we propose a clinically comparable intelligent system using the fusion of 5-channel EEG, HRV, and GSR data during resting state to aid in detecting MUD. Forty-six patients with MUD and 26 healthy controls were recruited and machine learning methods were employed to systematically compare the classification results of different fusion models. The analytic results revealed that the fusion of HRV and GSR features leads to the most accurate separation rate of 79%. The use of EEG, HRV, and GSR features provides more robust information, leading to relatively similar and enhanced accuracy across different classifiers. In conclusion, we demonstrated that a clinically applicable intelligent system using resting-state EEG, ECG, and GSR features without the induction of drug cue reactivity enhances the detection of MUD.

However, whether DADS alleviates chondrocyte injury by modulating NF-kB-dependent activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome remains unclear. In this study, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated chondrocytes were used as an in vitro model of osteoarthritis (OA) to investigate the effects of DADS. Effects of DADS treatment on cell viability, apoptosis, extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, and inflammation in chondrocytes were determined via several experiments. Western blot analysis was employed to examine the expression levels of NLRP3 inflammasome components and NF-kB signaling molecules. To determine whether DADS could act through the NF-kB pathway, caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), a specific NF-kB inhibitor, was used as a comparator. DADS treatment impaired LPS-induced chondrocyte apoptosis, ECM degeneration, and inflammation in a concentrationdependent manner. This was accompanied by a marked reduction in phosphorylated p65 level and downregulation of NLRP3, ASC, and Caspase-1 protein expression levels. Notably, CAPE exerted similar protective effects as DADS, reducing LPS-induced apoptosis, ECM degeneration, inflammatory cytokine production, and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. However, in the presence of CAPE, DADS did not confer additional benefits in LPS-stimulated chondrocytes, suggesting that its effects are primarily mediated through the NF-kB/NLRP3 signaling pathway.

The principal components of extracted features are first identified for non-responders' group. The first few components that sum up to 99% of explained variance are discarded to minimize inter-subject variability while the remaining projection vectors are applied on all response groups (24 non-responders, 15 partial-responders, 13 responders) to obtain their relative projections in feature space. The entire algorithm achieved a better performance through the radial basis function (RBF) support vector machine (SVM), with 82.70% accuracy, 78.44% sensitivity, 86.15% precision, and 91.02% specificity, respectively, when compared with conventional machine learning approaches that combine clinical, sociodemographic and genetic information as the predictor. The performance of the proposed custom algorithm suggests the prediction of ATR can be improved with multiple features sources, provided that the inter-subject variability is properly addressed, and can be an effective tool for clinical decision support system in MDD ATR prediction.","Engineering, Biomedical",Antidepressant Treatment Response Prediction With Early Assessment of Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy and Micro-RNA,,[]

Mammograms from 100 women across two screening rounds (400 images: 2 views x 2 rounds x 100 cases) were retrospectively collected. The prior mammographic views were subtracted from the most recent ones, 98 image features were extracted from regions of interest, and were ranked using 8 feature selection methods. Results: Machine learning reduced false positives and detected masses with 97.06% accuracy and 0.92 AUC. True masses were classified as benign or malignant with 94.82% accuracy and 0.95 AUC, a significant improvement compared with state-of-the-art methods reported in the literature (0.95 vs. 0.90 AUC). Conclusions: The proposed approach demonstrates that temporal subtraction can improve diagnostic accuracy by up to 5%, supporting earlier detection of malignancies and enabling more personalized treatment strategies.","Engineering, Biomedical",Subtraction of Temporally Sequential Digital Mammograms: Enhancing the Detection and Classification of Malignant Masses in Breast Imaging,,[]
,0,2025-01-01,IEEE JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL ENGINEERING IN HEALTH AND MEDICINE,"Objective: To examine how early pathophysiological changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) affect navigational decision-making by analyzing the complexity of driving routes in older adults with and without preclinical AD. Methods: We developed a novel route complexity metric based on the number of left and right turns and the deviation from the most direct path, accounting for cognitive load during navigation. Naturalistic GPS driving data were collected for a year from 111 older adults aged 65-85, with preclinical AD status determined via cerebrospinal fluid amyloid biomarkers. A multiple linear regression model was used to assess the relationship between age, preclinical AD status, and route complexity. Results: The findings of this study indicate that preclinical AD may influence the navigational abilities of older adults. After controlling for age, participants with preclinical AD chose routes with higher baseline complexity than the control group. It further revealed that participants with preclinical AD selected routes with lower complexity as they aged-a trend not observed in healthy controls. Conclusion: Preclinical AD is associated with changes in spatial decision-making that are observable in real-world driving behaviours. The age-related decline in route complexity among those with preclinical AD may reflect compensatory strategies or progressive cognitive changes. Clinical Impact: This study presents a non-invasive, behaviour-based metric that could support early detection of cognitive decline. It may also inform the design of personalized mobility interventions and dementia-friendly mobility systems.","Engineering, Biomedical",Characterizing Navigational Changes in Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease: A Route Complexity Metric Derived From Naturalistic Driving Data,,[]
,0,2025-01-01,BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY,"Although SARS-COV-2 started in 2019, its losses are still significant, and it takes victims. In the present study, the epidemic patterns of SARS-COV-2 disease have been investigated from the point of view of mathematical modeling. Also, the effect of quarantine has been considered. This mathematical model is designed in the form of fractional calculations along with a model predictive control (MPC) to monitor this model. The fractional-order model has the memory and hereditary properties of the system, which can provide more adjustable parameters to the designer. Because the MPC can predict future outputs, it can overcome the conditions and events that occur in the future. The results of the simulations show that the proposed nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) of fractional-order has a lower mean squared error in susceptible people compared to the optimal control of fractional-order (similar to 3.6e-04 vs. 47.4). This proposed NMPC of fractional-order can be used for other models of epidemics.","Engineering, Biomedical",Is it Curbing-spread of SARS-CoV-2 Variants by Considering Non-linear Predictive Control?,,[]
,0,2025-01-01,JOURNAL OF HARD TISSUE BIOLOGY,"Hydroxyapatite (HAp) is widely used as an artificial bone graft material in orthopedic and dental surgeries because of its excellent biocompatibility. However, the slow biodegradation rate of HAp scaffolds can increase the risk of infection at implanted sites and hinder bone tissue regeneration. Carbonated apatite (CA), which is a substituted HAp with carbonate ions replaced by phosphate ions in the HAp lattice, has been demonstrated to exhibit higher solubility than that exhibited by HAp. Therefore, this study investigated porous CA-based blocks fabricated by sintering a mixture of CA powder and organic beads. The synthesized CA, identified as B-type CA, had a carbonate content of 8%, which is close to that present in natural bones. The fabricated CA block, with over 60% porosity, promoted osteoblast activity and new bone formation within the pores. The porous CA blocks were implanted into the holes/defects created at different sites in the rabbit femur, and the in vivo behavior of the porous CA blocks was compared with that of the porous HA blocks. At one and three months after implantation, changes in the blocks and new bone formation were observed in different sites-cortical, cancellous, and bone marrow. At three months post-implantation, the HAp block hardly dissolved, whereas the implanted CA block dissolved in the cancellous bone and bone marrow, which have high blood flow. Additionally, at three months post-implantation, the CA blocks exhibited superior bone formation in the cortical bone and similar bone growth as compared to that exhibited by the HAp blocks. This study demonstrates that porous CA blocks are suitable alternatives to porous HAp blocks for use as bone scaffolds because of their superior osteoconductivity and biosolubility.","Engineering, Biomedical",In Vivo Dissolution Rate and Bone Regeneration Efficiency of Porous Carbonated Apatite Scaffolds: Comparative Study with Hydroxyapatite Scaffolds,,[]

,0,2025-01-01,IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY,"Introduction: Pedicle screw loosening is a major problem in spine surgery. Computed tomography (CT) is the gold standard to diagnose screw loosening. Disadvantages of CT include low sensitivity and specificity for the detection of loosened screws as well as the need for radiation exposure. The aim of this study was to provide a proof of concept of a novel, non-invasive, inductive sensing device for transcutaneous detection of screw loosening using a pulse induction metal detector. Materials/Methods: Two fresh frozen human cadavers were initially instrumented in the lumbar spinal region (L1 to L5). After assessment of the sensing device behavior using a wooden beam and 3D printed place holders of predefined distances, the ability of implant detection and screw stability determination were assessed during two experiments. Pedicle screw loosening was induced using 3D printed drill/loosening guides during the instrumentation of the lumbar spine. Screw stability was determined by applying weight to the spinous processes of interest and measuring the relative movement of the pedicle screw using the inductive sensor coil. Results: The sensitivity of our detection coil for an implant movement measurement showed to be high at close distances (60mV voltage change per mm movement), with signal amplitude vanishing at sensing distances of 50mm or greater. Signal amplitude significantly (p < .05) differed with the number of instrumented levels. When differentiating between instrumentation with and without loosened screws, significant (p < .05) mean differences were found in half of all comparative cases. All these differences were smaller than the predefined signal voltage threshold of (60 mV/mm). Discussion/Conclusion: In this study, the feasibility of a new, inductive and non-invasive sensor concept was tested. While the basic principle of the approach is promising, our implementation was not successful in demonstrating sufficient sensitivity for the required detectability. It appears conceivable that the concept can be successfully implemented with more sensitive sensors and more complex evaluation methods.","Engineering, Biomedical",Feasibility of an Inductive Pedicle Screw Loosening Detection Concept Using a Pulse Induction Metal Detector,,[]
,0,2025-01-01,ADVANCED BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING,"Microneedle arrays (MNAs) consisting of numerous tiny needles have attracted considerable attention for selective intradermal and subcutaneous delivery of pharmaceutical agents. Since reliable skin puncture and insertion are essential for dose control, applicators that push MNAs into the skin using springs or other mechanisms have been extensively researched. The puncture and insertion capabilities of an MNA depend on the compressive load generated when it is pressed against the skin. The compressive load is considered to be influenced not only by the MNA per se and the application method, but also by the structures and mechanical properties of the biological tissues at the application site. Nevertheless, most previous studies on evaluating the puncture and insertion abilities of MNAs did not consider the impact of subcutaneous soft tissues. In this study, the compressive loads generated by an applicator were measured at various sites of the body in 15 healthy adults. We used a proprietary test applicator that employed a spring to impact the skin at high speed, and a system that can measure the short-term load generated during impact. Furthermore, the structures and mechanical properties of the skin and subcutaneous soft tissues at the same body locations among the 15 individuals were evaluated and correlated with the measured compressive loads. The compressive load induced by the impact varied significantly with location, and correlated highly with the distance to the bone. There was no correlation with age, sex, or body mass index, or with the structure or mechanical properties of the skin. These results indicate that the structure of the subcutaneous tissue has a strong influence on the compression load and the ability to puncture and insert the MNA. The findings of this study can be useful for developing MNAs and applicators, determining their essential physical characteristics, selecting the appropriate administration locations, and developing non-clinical methods for evaluation.","Engineering, Biomedical",Compressive Loads Generated by Microneedle Arrays: Measurements at Multiple Body Locations in Healthy Adults,,[]

,2,2025-01-01,IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY,"Quality of Life (QoL) assessment has evolved over time, encompassing diverse aspects of human existence beyond just health. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the integration of Deep Learning (DL) techniques in QoL assessment, focusing on the analysis of wearable data. QoL, as defined by the World Health Organisation, encompasses physical, mental, and social well-being, making it a multifaceted concept. Traditional QoL assessment methods, often reliant on subjective reports or informal questioning, face challenges in quantification and standardization. To address these challenges, DL, a branch of machine learning inspired by the human brain, has emerged as a promising tool. DL models can analyze vast and complex datasets, including patient-reported outcomes, medical images, and physiological signals, enabling a deeper understanding of factors influencing an individual's QoL. Notably, wearable sensory devices have gained prominence, offering real-time data on vital signs and enabling remote healthcare monitoring. This review critically examines DL's role in QoL assessment through the use of wearable data, with particular emphasis on the subdomains of physical and psychological well-being. By synthesizing current research and identifying knowledge gaps, this review provides valuable insights for researchers, clinicians, and policymakers aiming to enhance QoL assessment with DL. Ultimately, the paper contributes to the adoption of advanced technologies to improve the well-being and QoL of individuals from diverse backgrounds.","Engineering, Biomedical",A Review on Deep Learning for Quality of Life Assessment Through the Use of Wearable Data,,[]
,0,2025-01-01,MEDICAL DEVICES-EVIDENCE AND RESEARCH,"Introduction: Sedatives and anesthetics can modify airway tone and induce respiratory depression, exacerbating the gas exchange impairments associated with obesity. In obese patients undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy, upper airway obstruction and hypo- ventilation are prevalent, leading to frequent occurrences of hypoxemia during the procedure. This study aims to investigate the effects of the nasopharyngeal airway in mitigating hypoxemia via alleviating upper airway obstruction in obese outpatients during painless gastrointestinal endoscopy procedure. Methods: This is a prospective single-center randomized controlled study. After signing the written informed consent, eligible outpatients scheduled for painless gastrointestinal endoscopy will be randomly allocated into the nasopharyngeal airway group (group N) and control group (group C), with 88 patients in each group. Patients in group N will undergo intubation of the nasopharyngeal airway prior to examination, whereas patients in group C will receive oxygen therapy through an endoscopic respiratory mask at a flow rate of 10 L/min during the procedure. All patients in two groups will receive propofol and opioids for procedural sedation. The primary outcome will be the incidence of hypoxemia. The secondary outcomes will be the incidence of epistaxis, suspended examination due to hypoxemia, manual ventilation, the times of attempt to nasopharynx airway insertion, duration of insertion of nasopharyngeal airway, tracheal/laryngeal mask intubation, adverse cardiovascular events, gastrointestinal complications, VAS score of nasopharynx pain after removing the nasopharyngeal airway, satisfaction score of patients, endoscopist and anesthesiologists. Discussion: This study evaluates the effects of nasopharyngeal airway insertion on hypoxemia caused by procedural sedation in obese patients undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy. The results of this study are expected to provide evidence for the use of nasopharyngeal airway in obese outpatients.

,0,2025-01-01,IEEE JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL ENGINEERING IN HEALTH AND MEDICINE,"Background: Accurate identification of bone metastases in lung cancer is essential for effective diagnosis and treatment. However, existing methods for detecting bone metastases face significant limitations, particularly in whole-body bone scans, due to low resolution, blurred boundaries, and the variability in lesion shapes and sizes, which challenge traditional convolutional neural networks. Purpose: To accurately isolate the metastasized lesions from whole-body bone scans, we propose a lesion-aware segmentation model using deep learning techniques. Methods: The proposed model integrates lesion boundary-guided strategies, multi-scale learning, and image shape guidance into an encoder-decoder architecture network. This approach significantly improves segmentation performance in low-resolution and blurred boundary conditions while effectively managing lesion shape variability and mitigating interference from the rectangular format of the images. Results: Experimental evaluations conducted on clinical data of 274 whole-body bone scans demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a 7.45% improvement in the Dice Similarity Coefficient and a 11.75% improvement in Recall compared to specialized segmentation models for whole-body bone scans, achieving significant improvements and balanced performance across key metrics. Conclusions: This model offers a more accurate and efficient solution for identifying bone metastases in lung cancer, alleviating the challenges of deep learning-based automated analysis of low-resolution, large-size medical images of whole-body bone scans. The code is available at https://github.com/carorange/segmentation Clinical and Impact: This lesion-aware deep learning model provides a robust, automated solution for identifying bone metastases in low-resolution, large-scale whole-body bone scans, enabling earlier and more accurate clinical decisions and potentially improving patient outcomes in lung cancer care.","Engineering, Biomedical",Integrating Non-Square Filter and Boundary Enhancement Into Encoder-Decoder Network for Lesion-Aware Segmentation of Large-Size Low-Resolution Bone Scintigrams,,[]
